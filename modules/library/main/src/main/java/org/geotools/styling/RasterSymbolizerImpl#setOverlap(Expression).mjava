     * The OverlapBehavior element tells a system how to behave when multiple raster images in a
     * layer overlap each other, for example with satellite-image scenes. LATEST_ON_TOP and
     * EARLIEST_ON_TOP refer to the time the scene was captured. AVERAGE means to average multiple
     * scenes together. This can produce blurry results if the source images are not perfectly
     * aligned in their geo-referencing. RANDOM means to select an image (or piece thereof) randomly
     * and place it on top. This can produce crisper results than AVERAGE potentially more
     * efficiently than LATEST_ON_TOP or EARLIEST_ON_TOP. The default behaviour is system-dependent.
     *
     * @param overlap the expression which evaluates to LATEST_ON_TOP, EARLIEST_ON_TOP, AVERAGE or
     *     RANDOM
