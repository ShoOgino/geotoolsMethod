     * The ChannelSelection element specifies the false-color channel selection for a multi-spectral
     * raster source (such as a multi-band satellite-imagery source). Either a channel may be
     * selected to display in each of red, green, and blue, or a single channel may be selected to
     * display in grayscale. (The spelling ?gray? is used since it seems to be more common on the
     * Web than ?grey? by a ratio of about 3:1.) Contrast enhancement may be applied to each channel
     * in isolation. Channels are identified by a system and data-dependent character identifier.
     * Commonly, channels will be labelled as ?1?, ?2?, etc.
     *
