     * This parameter gives the solid color that will be used for a stroke.<br>
     * The color value is RGB-encoded using two hexidecimal digits per
     * primary-color component in the order Red, Green, Blue, prefixed with
     * the hash (#) sign.  The hexidecimal digits between A and F may be in
     * either upper or lower case.  For example, full red is encoded as
     * "#ff0000"  (with no quotation marks).  The default color is defined to
     * be black ("#000000"). Note: in CSS this parameter is just called Stroke
     * and not Color.

     * @return The color of the stroke encoded as a hexidecimal RGB value.
