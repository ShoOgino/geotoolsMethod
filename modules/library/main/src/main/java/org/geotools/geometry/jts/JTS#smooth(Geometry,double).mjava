     * be present in the output Geometry.

     * line segments, with a value of 1 being tightest and 0 being loosest. Values outside this
     * range will be adjusted up or down as required.
     *
     * <p>The input Geometry can be a simple type (e.g. LineString, Polygon), a multi-type (e.g.
     * MultiLineString, MultiPolygon) or a GeometryCollection. The returned object will be of the
     * same type.
