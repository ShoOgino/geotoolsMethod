     * A safe cast to SimpleFeatureCollection; that will introduce a wrapper if it has to.
     *
     * <p>Please keep the use of this class to a minimum; if you are expecting a
     * FeatureCollection<SimpleFeatureType,SimpleFeature> please make use of SimpleFeatureCollection
     * if you possibly can.
     *
     * <p>So when are you stuck using this class?:
     *
     * <ul>
     *   <li>Offering backwards compatible constructors for legacy code prior to 2.7
     *   <li>implementing FeatureStore.addFeatures(...) since we cannot type narrow parameters
     * </ul>
     *
     * @param featureCollection will be returned as a SimpleFeatureCollection and wrapped only if
     *     needed
     * @return SimpleFeatureCollection
     * @since 2.7
