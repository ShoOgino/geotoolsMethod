     * Returns the name of the features (strictly, the name of the {@code AttributeDescriptor} for

     *
     * <p>The value returned by this method can be different to that returned by {@code
     * featureSource.getSchema().getType().getName()}. This is because there is a distinction
     * between the name applied to features and the name of a feature type. When working with {@code
     * SimpleFeature} and {@code SimpleFeatureType}, for example with a shapefile data source, it is
     * common practice for feature and feature type names to be the same. However, this is not the
     * case more generally. For instance, a database can contain two tables with the same structure.
     * The feature name will refer to the table while the feature type name refers to the schema
     * (table structure).
     *
     * @since 2.5
