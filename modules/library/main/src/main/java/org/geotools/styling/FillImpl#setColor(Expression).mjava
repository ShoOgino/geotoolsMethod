     * This parameter gives the solid color that will be used for a Fill.<br>

     * the order Red, Green, Blue, prefixed with the hash (#) sign. The hexidecimal digits between A
     * and F may be in either upper or lower case. For example, full red is encoded as "#ff0000"
     * (with no quotation marks).
     *
     * <p>Note: in CSS this parameter is just called Fill and not Color.
     *
