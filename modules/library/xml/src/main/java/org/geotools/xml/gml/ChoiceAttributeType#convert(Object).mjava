	/**
	 * Yet another hack in order to use our FeatureType.  Converts object to the "real" attribute type.  
	 * 
	 * Best to explain by Example.
	 * <p>
	 *  Consider a choice between Polygon and MultiPolygon.  It doesn't make sense
	 *  to be a Geometry Attribute Type since normal attribute type inspection will allow
	 *  users/clients to set Points and lines as legal attribute.  For parsing purposes,
	 *  this make the FeatureType a little more accurate.  It is not perfect of course since
	 *  The choice Line, Polygon and MultiPolygon still has to be of Type Geometry but it is a little better.
