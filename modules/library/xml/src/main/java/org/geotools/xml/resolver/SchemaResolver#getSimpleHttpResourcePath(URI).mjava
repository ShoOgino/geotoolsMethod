     * Return the Simple HTTP Resource Path for an absolute http/https URL.
     * 
     * <p>
     * 
     * The Simple HTTP Resource Path maps an HTTP or HTTPS URL to a path on the classpath or
     * relative to some other root. To form the Simple HTTP Resource Path from an http/https URL:
     * 
     * <ol>
     * <li>Protocol, port, fragment, and query are ignored.</li>
     * <li>Take the host name, split it into its components, reverse their order, prepend a forward
     * slash to each, and concatenate them.</li>
     * <li>Append the path component of the URL.</li>
     * </ol>
     * 
     * For example <code>http://schemas.example.org/exampleml/exml.xsd</code> becomes
     * <code>/org/example/schemas/exampleml/exml.xsd</code> .
     * 
     * <p>
     * 
     * The Simple HTTP Resource Path always starts with a forward slash (if not null). Does not
     * include query components in the path.
     * 
     * @param location
     *            not null
     * @return the Simple HTTP Resource Path as a string, or null if the URI is not an absolute
     *         HTTP/HTTPS URL.
