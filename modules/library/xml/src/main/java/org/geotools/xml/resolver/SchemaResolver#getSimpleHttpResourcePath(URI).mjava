    /**
     * Return the Simple HTTP Resource Path for an absolute http/https URL.
     *
     * <p>The Simple HTTP Resource Path maps an HTTP or HTTPS URL to a path on the classpath or
     * relative to some other root. To form the Simple HTTP Resource Path from an http/https URL:
     *
     * <ol>
     *   <li>Protocol, port, fragment, and query are ignored.
     *   <li>Take the host name, split it into its components, reverse their order, prepend a
     *       forward slash to each, and concatenate them.
     *   <li>Append the path component of the URL.
     * </ol>
     *
     * For example <code>http://schemas.example.org/exampleml/exml.xsd</code> becomes <code>
     * /org/example/schemas/exampleml/exml.xsd</code> .
     *
     * <p>The Simple HTTP Resource Path always starts with a forward slash (if not null). Does not
     * include query components in the path.
     *
     * @param location not null
     * @return the Simple HTTP Resource Path as a string, or null if the URI is not an absolute
     *     HTTP/HTTPS URL.
