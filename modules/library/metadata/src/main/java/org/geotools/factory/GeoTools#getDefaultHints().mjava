    /**
     * Returns the default set of hints used for the various utility classes. This default set is

     *
     * <p>
     *
     * <ul>
     *   <li>The {@linplain System#getProperties system properties} available. Some property keys
     *       are enumerated in the {@link GeoTools} class.
     *   <li>Any hints added by call to the {@link Hints#putSystemDefault} or {@link #init} method.
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p><b>Long term plan:</b> We would like to transition the utility classes to being injected
     * with their required factories, either by taking Hints as part of their constructor, or
     * otherwise. Making this change would be a three step process 1) create instance methods for
     * each static final class method 2) create an singleton instance of the class 3) change each
     * static final class method into a call to the singleton. With this in place we could then
     * encourage client code to make use of utility class instances before eventually retiring the
     * static final methods.
     *
     * @return A copy of the default hints. It is safe to add to it.
