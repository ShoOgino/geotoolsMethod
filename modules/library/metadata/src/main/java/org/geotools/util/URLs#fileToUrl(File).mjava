     * The handling of file.toURL() is broken; the handling of file.toURI().toURL() is known to be broken on a few platforms like mac. We have the
     * urlToFile( URL ) method that is able to untangle both these problems and we use it in the geotools library.
     * <p>
     * However occasionally we need to pick up a file and hand it to a third party library like EMF; this method performs a couple of sanity checks
     * which we can use to prepare a good URL reference to a file in these situtations.
     * 
     * @param file
