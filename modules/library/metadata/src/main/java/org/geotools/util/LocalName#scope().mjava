     * Returns the scope (name space) in which this name is local. The scope is set on creation and

     * with a {@linkplain NameSpace name space} having the name {@code "org.opengis"}, then the

     * @since 2.3
     * @todo To be strict, maybe we should returns {@code null} if there is no namespace. Current
     *     implementation returns a namespace instance whith a null name. This behavior is for
     *     transition from legacy API to later ISO 19103 revision and may change in future GeoTools
     *     version.
