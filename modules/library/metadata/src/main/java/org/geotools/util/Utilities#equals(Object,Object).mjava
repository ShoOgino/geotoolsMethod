    /**
     * Convenience method for testing two objects for equality. One or both objects may be null.
     * This method do <strong>not</strong> iterates recursively in array elements. If array needs to
     * be compared, use one of {@link Arrays} method or {@link #deepEquals deepEquals} instead.
     *
     * <p><b>Note on assertions:</b> There is no way to ensure at compile time that this method is
     * not invoked with array arguments, while doing so would usually be a program error. Performing
     * a systematic argument check would impose a useless overhead for correctly implemented {@link
     * Object#equals} methods. As a compromise we perform this check at runtime only if assertions
     * are enabled. Using assertions for argument check in a public API is usually a deprecated
     * practice, but we make an exception for this particular method.
     *
     * <p><b>Note on method overloading:</b> This method could be selected by the compiler for
     * comparing primitive types, because the compiler could perform an auto-boxing and get a result
     * assignable to {@code Object}. However it should not occur in practice because overloaded (and
     * more efficient) methods are provided for every primitive types. This is true even when the
     * two arguments are different primitive type because of widening conversions. The only
     * exception is when a {@code boolean} argument is mixed with a different primitive type.
     *
     * @param object1 The first object to compare, or {@code null}.
     * @param object2 The second object to compare, or {@code null}.
     * @return {@code true} if both objects are equal.
     * @throws AssertionError If assertions are enabled and at least one argument is an array.
