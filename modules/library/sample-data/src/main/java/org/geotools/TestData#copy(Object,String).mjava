     * Copies the named resources from the {@code sample-data} module to the {@code test-data}
     * directory in an other module. For example if {@code TestData.copy(this, "foo.txt")} is
     * invoked inside a test suite in the {@code org.geotools.foo} package, then this method copies
     * {@code org/geotools/test-data/foo.txt} (from {@code sample-data} module) to {@code
     * org/geotools/foo/test-data/foo.txt} (in the {@code foo} module).
     *
     * <p>This method is useful when a test case needs to access a resource through a {@link File},
     * for example because it want to open it using {@link java.io.RandomAccess}. Because the
     * resources provided in the {@code sample-data} module are available to other modules as a JAR
     * file, other modules can only access them through an {@link URL} unless they copy them in
     * their own {@code test-data} directory.
     *
     * <p>If the named file already exists in the caller {@code test-data} directory, then this
     * method does nothing. It make it safe to invoke this method many time in a test suite, since
     * this method should not copy the file more than once for a given JVM execution.
     *
     * <p>The file will be {@linkplain File#deleteOnExit deleted on exit} if and only if it has been
     * modified. Callers don't need to worry about cleanup, because the files are copied in the
     * {@code target/.../test-data} directory, which is not versionned by SVN and is cleaned by
     * Maven on {@code mvn clean} execution.
     *
     * @param caller Calling class or object used to locate the destination {@code test-data}.
     * @param name Path to file in {@code org/geotools/test-data}.
     * @return The file to the <code>org/geotools/<strong>caller-package</strong>/test-data</code>
     *     resource copy, returned for convenience.
     * @throws FileNotFoundException if the file is not found.
     * @throws IOException if the resource can't be fetched for an other reason.
