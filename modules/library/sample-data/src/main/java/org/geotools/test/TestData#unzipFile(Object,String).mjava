     * Unzip a file in the {@code test-data} directory. The zip file content is inflated in place,
     * i.e. inflated files are written in the same {@code test-data} directory. If a file to be
     * inflated already exists in the {@code test-data} directory, then the existing file is left
     * untouched and the corresponding ZIP entry is silently skipped. This approach avoid the
     * overhead of inflating the same files many time if this {@code unzipFile} method is invoked
     * before every tests.
     *
     * <p>Inflated files will be automatically {@linkplain File#deleteOnExit deleted on exit} if and
     * only if they have been modified. Callers don't need to worry about cleanup, because the files
     * are inflated in the {@code target/.../test-data} directory, which is not versionned by SVN
     * and is cleaned by Maven on {@code mvn clean} execution.
     *
     * @param caller The class of the object associated with named data.
     * @param name The file name to unzip in place.
     * @throws FileNotFoundException if the specified zip file is not found.
     * @throws IOException if an error occurs during an input or output operation.
