     * Provides a {@link java.io.BufferedReader} for named test data. It is the caller

     *
     * @param caller The class of the object associated with named data.
     * @param name of test data to load.
     * @return The reader, or {@code null} if the named test data are not found.
     * @throws IOException if an error occurs during an input operation.
     * @deprecated Use {@link #openReader} instead. The {@code openReader} method throws an
     *     exception if the resource is not found, instead of returning null. This make debugging
     *     easier, since it replaces infamous {@link NullPointerException} by a more explicit error
     *     message during tests. Furthermore, the {@code openReader} name make it more obvious that
     *     the stream is not closed automatically and is also consistent with other method names in
     *     this class.
