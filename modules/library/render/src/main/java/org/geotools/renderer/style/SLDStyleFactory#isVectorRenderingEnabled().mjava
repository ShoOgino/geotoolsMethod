	 * meaning that graphic fills are painted as raster images using Java
	 * TexturePaint, and SVGs are rendered to a BufferedImage prior to painting
	 * on the target Graphics. This common behavior is faster and more suitable
	 * for on-screen rendering. Enabling this flag is recommended for rendering
	 * to off-screen Graphics such as when printing, cases in which the full
	 * quality of the original data should normally be preserved.
