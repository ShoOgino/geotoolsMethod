     * Sets a definition query for the layer which acts as a filter for the features that the layer

     * <p>A consumer must ensure that this query is used in combination with the bounding box filter
     * generated on each map interaction to limit the number of features returned to those that
     * complains both the definition query and relies inside the area of interest.
     *
     * <p>IMPORTANT: only include attribute names in the query if you want them to be ALWAYS
     * returned. It is desirable to not include attributes at all but let the renderer decide which
     * attributes are actually needed to perform its required operation.
     *
     * <p>WARNING: We do not check if your query is suitable for the layer {@code FeatureSource} you
     * may accidentally return no features; resulting in an "empty" layer.
     *
     * @param query the full filter for this layer.

     *     query, pass it {@link Query.ALL} instead of <code>null</code>
