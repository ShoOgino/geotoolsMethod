     * Supply a FeatureCollection indicating where the raster is located, we ask that the features

     * <p>This is an interesting method for a RasterLayer to have; some of the rendering systems are
     * willing to render your raster content as an outline; for this to work they need this method
     * to supply a feature collection indicating where the content is located. The information may
     * also be used to determine if any of your raster content is on screen (and thus needs to be
     * rendered).
     *
     * <p>Note this is a feature collection to allow for raster content that contains more than one
     * image; and is not based bounding boxes (as sometimes rasters are rotated or stretched into
     * position).
     *
     * <p>You may find the {@link FeatureUtilities} useful in wrapping up your raster content.
