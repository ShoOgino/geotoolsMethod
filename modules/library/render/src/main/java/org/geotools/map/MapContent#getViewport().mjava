     * single viewport representing what the user is seeing on screen.
     *
     * <p>With that in mind; if the user has not already supplied a viewport one will be created:
     *
     * <ul>
     *   <li>The viewport will be configured to show the extent of the current layers as provided by
     *       {@link #getMaxBounds()}.
     *   <li>The viewport will have an empty {@link MapViewport#getBounds()} if no layers have been
     *       added yet.
     * </ul>
     *
     * @return MapViewport describing how to draw this map
