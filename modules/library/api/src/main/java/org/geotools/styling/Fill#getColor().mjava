     * the order Red, Green, Blue, prefixed with the hash (#) sign. The hexidecimal digits beetween
     * A and F may be in either upper or lower case. For example, full red is encoded as "#ff0000"
     * (with no quotation marks). The default color is defined to be 50% gray ("#808080"). Note: in
     * CSS this parameter is just called Fill and not Color.
