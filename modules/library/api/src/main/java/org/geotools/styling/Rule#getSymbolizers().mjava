     * end result is to be as intended. All symbolizers should be applied to
     * all features which make it through the filters in this rule regardless
     * of the features' geometry. For example, a polygon symbolizer should be
     * applied to line geometries and even points.  If this is not the desired
     * beaviour, ensure that either the filters block inappropriate features
     * or that the FeatureTypeStyler which contains this rule has its
     * FeatureTypeName or SemanticTypeIdentifier set appropriately.
