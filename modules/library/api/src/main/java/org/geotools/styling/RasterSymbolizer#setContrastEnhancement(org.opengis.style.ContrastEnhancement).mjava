    /**
     * The ContrastEnhancement element defines contrast enhancement for a
     * channel of a false-color image or for a color image. In the case of a
     * color image, the relative grayscale brightness of a pixel color is
     * used. ?Normalize? means to stretch the contrast so that the dimmest
     * color is stretched to black and the brightest color is stretched to
     * white, with all colors in between stretched out linearly. ?Histogram?
     * means to stretch the contrast based on a histogram of how many colors
     * are at each brightness level on input, with the goal of producing equal
     * number of pixels in the image at each brightness level on output.  This
     * has the effect of revealing many subtle ground features. A ?GammaValue?
     * tells how much to brighten (value greater than 1.0) or dim (value less
     * than 1.0) an image. The default GammaValue is 1.0 (no change). If none
     * of Normalize, Histogram, or GammaValue are selected in a
     * ContrastEnhancement, then no enhancement is performed.
