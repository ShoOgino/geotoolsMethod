     * FeatureType that best represents the contents of this collection.
     * <ul>
     * <li>The degenerate case returns the "_Feature" FeatureType, where the
     * onlything known is that the contents are Features.
     * <li>For a collection backed by a shapefiles (or database tables) the FeatureType returned by getSchema() will
     * complete describe each and every child in the collection.
     * <li>For mixed content FeatureCollections you will need to check the FeatureType of each Feature as it
     * is retrived from the collection
     * </ul>

     * <p>
     * The method getSchema() is named for compatability with the geotools 2.0 API. In the
     * Geotools 2.2 time frame we should be able to replace this method with a careful check
     * of getFeatureType() and its attributes.
