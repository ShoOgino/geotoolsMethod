     * Set hints to control the query execution.
     *
     * <p>Hints can control such things as:
     *
     * <ul>
     *   <li>the GeometryFactory to be used
     *   <li>a generalization distance to be applied
     *   <li>the fetch size to be used in JDBC queries
     * </ul>
     *
     * The set of hints supported can be found by calling {@linkplain
     * org.geotools.data.FeatureSource#getSupportedHints() }.
     *
     * <p>Note: Data sources may ignore hints (depending on their values) and no mechanism currently
     * exists to discover which hints where actually used during the query's execution.
