    /**
     * Obtain a FeatureIterator<SimpleFeature> of the Features within this FeatureCollection.
     *
     * <p>The implementation of FeatureIterator must adhere to the rules of fail-fast concurrent
     * modification. In addition (to allow for resource backed collections) the <code>
     * FeatureIterator.close()</code> method must be called.
     *
     * <p>Example use:
     *
     * <pre><code>
     * FeatureIterator<SimpleFeature> iterator=collection.features();
     * try {
     *     while( iterator.hasNext()  ){
     *          Feature feature = iterator.next();
     *          System.out.println( feature.getID() );
     *     }
     * }
     * finally {
     *     iterator.close();
     * }
     * </code></pre>
     *
     * <p>GML Note: The contents of this iterator are considered to be defined by
     * <b>featureMember</b> tags (and/or the single allowed <b>FeatureMembers</b> tag). Please see
     * getFeatureType for more details.
     *
     * @return A FeatureIterator.
