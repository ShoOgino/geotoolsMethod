    /**
     * SortBy results according to indicated property and order.
     *
     * <p>SortBy is part of the Filter 1.1 specification, it is referenced by WFS1.1 and Catalog
     * 2.0.x specifications and is used to organize results. The SortBy's are ment to be applied in
     * order:
     *
     * <ul>
     *   <li>SortBy( year, ascending )
     *   <li>SortBy( month, decsending )
     * </ul>
     *
     * Would produce something like:
     *
     * <pre><code>
     * [year=2002 month=4],[year=2002 month=3],[year=2002 month=2],
     * [year=2002 month=1],[year=2003 month=12],[year=2002 month=4],
     * </code></pre>
     *
     * <p>SortBy should be considered at the same level of abstraction as Filter, and like Filter
     * you may sort using properties not listed in getPropertyNames.
     *
     * <p>At a technical level the interface SortBy2 is used to indicate the additional requirements
     * of a GeoTools implementation. The pure WFS 1.1 specification itself is limited to SortBy.
     *
     * @return SortBy array or order of application
