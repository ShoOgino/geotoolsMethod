     * single style may be suitable to use with many different feature types. The syntax of the
     * SemanticTypeIdentifiers string is undefined, but the strings "generic:line_string",
     * "generic:polygon", "generic:point", "generic:text", "generic:raster", and "generic:any" are
     * reserved to indicate that a FeatureTypeStyle may be used with any feature type with the
     * corresponding default geometry type (i.e., no feature properties are referenced in the
     * feature type style).
     *
     * @param types An array of strings representing systematic types which could be styled by this
     *     instance.
     * @deprecated Please use semanticIdentifiers().addAll()
