     * The value returned by this method can be different to that returned by
     * {@code featureSource.getSchema().getType().getName()}.
     * This is because there is a distinction between the name applied to features
     * and the name of a feature type. When working with {@code SimpleFeature} and
     * {@code SimpleFeatureType}, for example with a shapefile data source, it is
     * common practice for feature and feature type names to be the same. However, this
     * is not the case more generally. For instance, a database can contain two
     * tables with the same structure. The feature name will refer to the table
     * while the feature type name refers to the schema (table structure).
