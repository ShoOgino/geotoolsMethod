     * Returns a color model for this sample dimension. The default implementation create the color

     *     ignored.
     * @param numBands The number of bands for the color model (usually 1). The returned color model
     *     will renderer only the {@code visibleBand} and ignore the others, but the existence of
     *     all {@code numBands} will be at least tolerated. Supplemental bands, even invisible, are
     *     useful for processing with Java Advanced Imaging.
     * @return The requested color model, suitable for {@link java.awt.image.RenderedImage} objects
     *     with values in the <code>{@link #getRange}</code> range. May be {@code null} if this
     *     sample dimension has no category.
     * @todo This method may be deprecated in a future version. It it strange to use only one {@code
     *     SampleDimension} object for creating a multi-bands color model. Logically, we would
     *     expect as many {@code SampleDimension}s as bands.
