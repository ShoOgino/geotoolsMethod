    /**
     * Provides a hint that a coverage will no longer be accessed from a reference in user space.
     * This can be used as a hint in situations where waiting for garbage collection would be overly
     * conservative. The results of referencing a coverage after a call to {@code dispose} are
     * undefined, except if this method returned {@code false}.
     *
     * <p>This method can work in a <cite>conservative</cite> mode or a <cite>forced</cite> mode,
     * determined by the {@code force} argument:
     *
     * <ul>
     *   <li>
     *       <p>If {@code force} is {@code false} (the recommanded value), this method may process
     *       only under some conditions. For example a grid coverage may dispose its planar image
     *       only if it has no {@linkplain PlanarImage#getSinks sinks}. This method returns {@code
     *       true} if it disposed all resources, or {@code false} if this method vetoed against the
     *       disposal. In the later case, this coverage can still be used.
     *   <li>
     *       <p>If {@code force} is {@code true}, then this method processes inconditionnally and
     *       returns always {@code true}. This is a more risky behavior.
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>The conservative mode ({@code force = false}) performs its safety checks on a
     * <cite>best-effort</cite> basis, with no guarantees. Therefore, it would be wrong to write a
     * program that depended on the safety checks for its correctness. In case of doubt about
     * whatever this coverage still in use or not, it is safer to rely on the garbage collector.
     *
     * @param force {@code true} for forcing an inconditionnal disposal, or {@code false} for
     *     performing a conservative disposal. The recommanded value is {@code false}.
     * @return {@code true} if this method disposed at least some resources, or {@code false} if
     *     this method vetoed against the disposal.
     * @see PlanarImage#dispose
     * @since 2.4
