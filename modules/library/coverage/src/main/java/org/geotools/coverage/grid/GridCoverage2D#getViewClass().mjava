     * same sample dimensions) are suffisient only if the coverages build the views in the same
     * way. The last condition can be garantee only if we know how {@link #specialize} is
     * implemented. It is safe for non-{@link Calculator2D} classes (because users can not
     * override {@link #specialize} and for final classes like {@link Interpolator2D}, but
     * the later must returns a different class in order to tells {@link ViewsManager} that
     * it does not build the views in the same way.
