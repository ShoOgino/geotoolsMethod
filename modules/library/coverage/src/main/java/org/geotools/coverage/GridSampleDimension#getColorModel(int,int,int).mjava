     * Returns a color model for this sample dimension. The default implementation create the
     * color model using each category's colors as returned by {@link Category#getColors}.
     *
     * @param  visibleBand The band to be made visible (usually 0). All other bands, if any
     *         will be ignored.
     * @param  numBands The number of bands for the color model (usually 1). The returned color
     *         model will renderer only the {@code visibleBand} and ignore the others, but
     *         the existence of all {@code numBands} will be at least tolerated. Supplemental
     *         bands, even invisible, are useful for processing with Java Advanced Imaging.
     * @param  type The data type that has to be used for the sample model.
     * @return The requested color model, suitable for {@link java.awt.image.RenderedImage} objects
     *         with values in the <code>{@link #getRange}</code> range. May be {@code null} if this
     *         sample dimension has no category.
     *
     * @todo This method may be deprecated in a future version. It it strange to use
     *       only one {@code SampleDimension} object for creating a multi-bands color
     *       model. Logically, we would expect as many {@code SampleDimension}s as bands.
