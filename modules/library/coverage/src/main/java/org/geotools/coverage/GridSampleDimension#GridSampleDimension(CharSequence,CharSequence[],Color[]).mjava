    /**
     * Constructs a sample dimension with a set of qualitative categories and colors. This
     * constructor expects a sequence of category names for the values contained in a sample
     * dimension. This allows for names to be assigned to numerical values. The first entry in
     * the sequence relates to a cell value of zero. For example: [0]="Background", [1]="Water",
     * [2]="Forest", [3]="Urban". The created sample dimension will have no unit and a default
     * set of colors.
     *
     * @param description
     *            The sample dimension title or description, or {@code null} for the default
     *            (the name of what looks like the "main" category). This is the value to be
     *            returned by {@link #getDescription}.
     * @param names
     *            Sequence of category names for the values contained in a sample dimension,
     *            as {@link String} or {@link InternationalString} objects.
     * @param colors
     *            Color to assign to each category. This array must have the
     *            same length than {@code names}.
     *
