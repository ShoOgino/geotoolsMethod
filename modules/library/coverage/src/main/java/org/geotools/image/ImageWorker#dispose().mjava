     * can be used as a hint in situations where waiting for garbage collection would be overly
     * conservative.
     *
     * <p>Mind, this also results in disposing the JAI Image chain attached to the image the worker
     * is applied to, so don't call this method on image changes (full/partial) that you want to
     * use.
     *
     * <p>{@link ImageWorker} defines this method to remove the image being disposed from the list
     * of sinks in all of its source images. The results of referencing an {@link ImageWorker} after
     * a call to dispose() are undefined.
