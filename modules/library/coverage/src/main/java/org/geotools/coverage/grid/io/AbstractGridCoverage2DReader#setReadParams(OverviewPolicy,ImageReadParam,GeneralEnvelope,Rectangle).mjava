     * resolution. It also returns and {@link Integer} representing the index of the raster to be read when dealing with multipage raster.
     * 
     * @param overviewPolicy it can be one of {@link Hints#VALUE_OVERVIEW_POLICY_IGNORE}, {@link Hints#VALUE_OVERVIEW_POLICY_NEAREST},
     *        {@link Hints#VALUE_OVERVIEW_POLICY_QUALITY} or {@link Hints#VALUE_OVERVIEW_POLICY_SPEED}. It specifies the policy to compute the
     *        overviews level upon request.
     * @param readP an instance of {@link ImageReadParam} for setting the subsampling factors.
     * @param requestedEnvelope the {@link GeneralEnvelope} we are requesting.
     * @param requestedDim the requested dimensions.
     * @return the index of the raster to read in the underlying data source.
