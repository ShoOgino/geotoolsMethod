     *     {@link Hints#VALUE_OVERVIEW_POLICY_SPEED}. It specifies the policy to compute the
     *     overviews level upon request.
     * @param readP an instance of {@link ImageReadParam} for setting the subsampling factors.
     * @param requestedEnvelope the {@link GeneralEnvelope} we are requesting.
