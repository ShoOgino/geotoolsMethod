     * Constructs a quantitative category for sample values in the specified range.
     *
     * @param name The category name as a {@link String} or {@link InternationalString} object.
     * @param colors A set of colors for this category. This array may have any length; colors will
     *     be interpolated as needed. An array of length 1 means that an uniform color should be
     *     used for all sample values. An array of length 0 or a {@code null} array means that some
     *     default colors should be used (usually a gradient from opaque black to opaque white).
     * @param sampleValueRange The range of sample values for this category. Element class is
     *     usually {@link Integer}, but {@link Float} and {@link Double} are accepted as well.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if {@code lower} is not smaller than {@code upper}, or if
     *     {@code scale} or {@code offset} are not real numbers.
