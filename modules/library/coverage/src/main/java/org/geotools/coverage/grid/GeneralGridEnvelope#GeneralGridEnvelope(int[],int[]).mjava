     *
     * @param low
     *          The valid minimum inclusive grid coordinate. The array contains a minimum
     *          value (inclusive) for each dimension of the grid coverage. The lowest valid
     *          grid coordinate is often zero, but this is not mandatory.
     * @param high
     *          The valid maximum grid coordinate. The array contains a maximum
     *          value for each dimension of the grid coverage.
     * @param isHighIncluded
     *          {@code true} if the {@code high} values are inclusive (as in ISO 19123
     *          specification), or {@code false} if they are exclusive (as in Java usage).
     *          This argument does not apply to low values, which are always inclusive.
     *
