     *
     * @param low The valid minimum inclusive grid coordinate. The array contains a minimum value
     *     (inclusive) for each dimension of the grid coverage. The lowest valid grid coordinate is
     *     often zero, but this is not mandatory.
     * @param high The valid maximum grid coordinate. The array contains a maximum value for each
     *     dimension of the grid coverage.
     * @param isHighIncluded {@code true} if the {@code high} values are inclusive (as in ISO 19123
     *     specification), or {@code false} if they are exclusive (as in Java usage). This argument
     *     does not apply to low values, which are always inclusive.
