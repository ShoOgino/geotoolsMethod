     * Casts the specified envelope into a grid envelope. This is sometime useful after an
     * envelope has been transformed from "real world" coordinates to grid coordinates using the
     * {@linkplain org.opengis.coverage.grid.GridGeometry#getGridToCRS grid to CRS} transform.
     * The floating point values are rounded toward the nearest integers.

     * According OpenGIS specification, {@linkplain org.opengis.coverage.grid.GridGeometry grid
     * geometry} maps pixel's center. But envelopes typically encompass all pixels. This means
     * that grid coordinates (0,0) has an envelope starting at (-0.5, -0.5). In order to revert
     * back such envelope to a grid envelope, it is necessary to add 0.5 to every coordinates
     * (including the maximum value since it is exclusive in a grid envelope). This offset is
     * applied only if {@code anchor} is {@link PixelInCell#CELL_CENTER}. Users who don't want
     * such offset should specify {@link PixelInCell#CELL_CORNER}.
     * <p>
     * The convention is specified as a {@link PixelInCell} code instead than the more detailed
     * {@link org.opengis.metadata.spatial.PixelOrientation} because the latter is restricted to
     * the two-dimensional case while the former can be used for any number of dimensions.
     *
     * @param envelope
     *          The envelope to use for initializing this grid envelope.
     * @param anchor
     *          Whatever envelope coordinates map to pixel center or pixel corner. Should be
     *          {@link PixelInCell#CELL_CENTER} for OGC convention (an offset of 0.5 will be
     *          added to every envelope coordinate values), or {@link PixelInCell#CELL_CORNER}
     *          for Java2D/JAI convention (no offset will be added).
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException
     *          If {@code anchor} is not valid.
