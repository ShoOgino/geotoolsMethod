     * Returns an array of <code>Dimension</code>s indicating the legal size ranges for tiles. The

     * <p>The information is returned as a set of pairs; the first element of a pair contains an
     * (inclusive) minimum width and height, and the second element contains an (inclusive) maximum
     * width and height. Together, each pair defines a valid range of sizes. To specify a fixed

     * of <code>null</code> is used in place of an actual array of <code>Dimension</code>s.

     * returns <code>null</code>.
