    /**
     * The AnchorPoint element of a PointPlacement gives the location inside of a label to use for
     * anchoring the label to the main-geometry point.
     *
     * <p>This will often be used to avoid over-plotting a graphic symbol marking a city or some
     * such feature. The displacements are in units of pixels above and to the right of the point. A
     * system may reflect this displacement about the X and/or Y axes to de-conflict labels. The
     * default displacement is X=0, Y=0.
     *
     * <p>See {@link AnchorPoint} for details.
     *
     * @return AnchorPoint : if null use X=0.5 Y=0.5
