     * PerpendicularOffset allows to draw lines in parallel to the original geometry. For complex
     * line strings these parallel lines have to be constructed so that the distance between
     * original geometry and drawn line stays equal. This construction can result in drawn lines
     * that are actually smaller or longer than the original geometry.
     *
     * <p>The distance is in uoms and is positive to the left-hand side of the line string. Negative
     * numbers mean right. The default offset is 0.
