     * Returns the sources data for a coverage. This is intended to allow applications to establish

     * the "raw data".
     *
     * <p>This implementation specification does not include interfaces for creating collections of
     * coverages therefore the list size will usually be one indicating an adapted grid coverage, or
     * zero indicating a raw grid coverage.

     * <p><strong>WARNING:</strong> This method is inherited from the legacy OGC 01-004
     * specification and may be deprecated in a future version. We are for more experience and
     * feedbacks on the value of this method.
