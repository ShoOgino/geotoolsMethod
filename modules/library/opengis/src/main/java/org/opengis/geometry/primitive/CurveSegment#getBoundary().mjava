     * Returns an ordered pair of points, which are the start point and end point of the curve. This
     * method operates with the same semantics as that on {@linkplain Curve#getBoundary curve}
     * except that the end points of a {@code CurveSegment} are not necessarily existing {@linkplain
     * Point points} and thus the boundary may contain transient {@linkplain Point points}.

     * <font size=2> <strong>NOTE:</strong> The above {@linkplain CurveBoundary curve boundary} will
     * almost always be two distinct positions, but, like {@linkplain Curve curves}, {@code
     * CurveSegment}s can be cycles in themselves. The most likely scenario is that all of the
     * points used will be transients (constructed to support the return value), except for the
     * start point and end point of the aggregated {@linkplain Curve curve}. These two positions, in
     * the case where the {@linkplain Curve curve} is involved in a {@linkplain
     * org.opengis.geometry.complex.Complex complex}, will be represented as {@linkplain Point
     * points} in the same {@linkplain org.opengis.geometry.complex.Complex complex}. </font>
