     * Returns the set of {@linkplain GenericName generic names} registered with this namespace.
     * Duplicate names are forbidden. The names may be either:
     *
     * <p>
     *
     * <ul>
     *   <li>A {@link LocalName}.
     *   <li>A {@link ScopedName} with the following constraints:
     *       <ul>
     *         <li>All elements of the {@linkplain ScopedName#getParsedNames parsed names list}
     *             except for the {@linkplain ScopedName#tail tail} must refer to a {@code
     *             NameSpace}.
     *         <li>Each element of the {@linkplain ScopedName#getParsedNames parsed names list}
     *             except for the {@linkplain ScopedName#head head} must be defined in the {@code
     *             NameSpace} referred to by the previous element.
     *       </ul>
     * </ul>
     *
     * @return All generic names registered with this namespace.
     * @todo This method will put a significant burden on implementations (they will need to manage
     *     a list of names, probably through weak references, etc.). Is the ISO 19103 association
     *     really naviguable that way?
     * @deprecated Not implementable in a simple naming system. We may create a {@code Register}
     *     subclass (or something similar) later for this kind of job.
