    /**
     * A <b>copy</b> of the ordinates presented as an array of double values. Please note that this
     * is only a copy (the real values may be stored in another format) so changes to the returned
     * array will not affect the source DirectPosition.
     *
     * <blockquote>
     *
     * <pre>
     * final int dim = position.{@linkplain #getDimension getDimension}();
     * for (int i=0; i&lt;dim; i++) {
     *     position.{@linkplain #getOrdinate getOrdinate}(i); // no copy overhead
     * }
     * </pre>
     *
     * </blockquote>
     *
     * To manipulate ordinates, the following idiom can be used:
     *
     * <blockquote>
     *
     * <pre>
     * position.{@linkplain #setOrdinate setOrdinate}(i, value); // edit in place
     * </pre>
     *
     * </blockquote>
     *
     * There are a couple reasons for requerying a copy:
     *
     * <p>
     *
     * <ul>
     *   <li>We want an array of coordinates with the intend to modify it for computation purpose
     *       (without modifying the original {@code DirectPosition}), or we want to protect the
     *       array from future {@code DirectPosition} changes.
     *   <li>If {@code DirectPosition.getOrdinates()} is garanteed to not return the backing array,
     *       then we can work directly on this array. If we don't have this garantee, then we must
     *       conservatively clone the array in every cases.
     *   <li>Cloning the returned array is useless if the implementation cloned the array or was
     *       forced to returns a new array anyway (for example because the coordinates were computed
     *       on the fly)
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>Precedence is given to data integrity over {@code getOrdinates()} performance. Performance
     * concern can be avoided with usage of {@link #getOrdinate(int)}.
     *
     * @return A copy of the coordinates. Changes in the returned array will not be reflected back
     *     in this {@code DirectPosition} object.
