     * Returns {@code true} if this {@code Geometry} has an empty boundary after topological
     * simplification (removal of overlaps between components in non-structured aggregates, such as
     * subclasses of {@link org.opengis.geometry.aggregate.Aggregate}). This condition is alternatively
     * referred to as being "closed" as in a "closed curve." This creates some confusion since there
     * are two distinct and incompatible definitions for the word "closed". The use of the word cycle
     * is rarer (generally restricted to the field of algebraic topology), but leads to less confusion.
     * Essentially, an object is a cycle if it is isomorphic to a geometric object that is the
     * boundary of a region in some Euclidean space. Thus a curve is a cycle if it is isomorphic
     * to a circle (has the same start and end point). A surface is a cycle if it isomorphic to the
     * surface of a sphere, or some torus. A solid, with finite size, in a space of dimension 3 is
     * never a cycle.
