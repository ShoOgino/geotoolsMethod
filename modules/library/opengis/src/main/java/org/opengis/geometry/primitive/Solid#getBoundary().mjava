     * Returns a sequence of sets of {@linkplain Surface surfaces} that limit the extent of this

     * boundary component of this {@code Solid}. Each of these shells shall be a cycle
     * (closed composite surface without boundary).
     *
     * <blockquote><font size=2>
     * <strong>NOTE:</strong> The exterior shell of a solid is defined only because the embedding
     * coordinate space is always a 3D Euclidean one. In general, a solid in a bounded 3-dimensional
     * manifold has no distinguished exterior boundary. In cases where "exterior" boundary is not
     * well defined, all the shells of the {@linkplain SolidBoundary solid boundary} shall be
     * listed as "interior".
     * </font></blockquote>
     *
     * The {@linkplain OrientableSurface orientable surfaces} that bound a solid shall be oriented
     * outward - that is, the "top" of each {@linkplain Surface surface} as defined by its orientation
     * shall face away from the interior of the solid. Each {@linkplain Shell shell}, when viewed as
     * a composite surface, shall be a cycle.
     *
     * @return The sets of positions on the boundary.
