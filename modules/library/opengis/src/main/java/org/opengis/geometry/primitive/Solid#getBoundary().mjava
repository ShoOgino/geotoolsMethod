     * the embedding coordinate space is always a 3D Euclidean one. In general, a solid in a bounded
     * 3-dimensional manifold has no distinguished exterior boundary. In cases where "exterior"
     * boundary is not well defined, all the shells of the {@linkplain SolidBoundary solid boundary}
     * shall be listed as "interior". </font>

     * The {@linkplain OrientableSurface orientable surfaces} that bound a solid shall be oriented
     * outward - that is, the "top" of each {@linkplain Surface surface} as defined by its
     * orientation shall face away from the interior of the solid. Each {@linkplain Shell shell},
     * when viewed as a composite surface, shall be a cycle.
     *
