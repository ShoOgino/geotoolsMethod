     * Creates a transform by concatenating two existing transforms. A concatenated transform acts
     * in the same way as applying two transforms, one after the other.
     *
     * <p>The dimension of the output space of the first transform must match the dimension of the
     * input space in the second transform. If you wish to concatenate more than two transforms,
     * then you can repeatedly use this method.
     *
     * @param transform1 The first transform to apply to points.
     * @param transform2 The second transform to apply to points.
     * @return The concatenated transform.
     * @throws FactoryException if the object creation failed.
