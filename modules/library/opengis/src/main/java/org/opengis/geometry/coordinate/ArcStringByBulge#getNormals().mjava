    /**
     * Returns a vector normal (perpendicular) to the chord of the arc, the line joining the first
     * and last point of the arc. In a 2D coordinate system, there are only two possible directions
     * for the normal, and it is often given as a signed real, indicating its length, with a
     * positive sign indicating a left turn angle from the chord line, and a negative sign
     * indicating a right turn from the chord. In 3D, the normal determines the plane of the arc,
     * along with the {@linkplain #getStartPoint start} and {@linkplain #getEndPoint end point} of
     * the arc.
     *
     * <p>The normal is usually a unit vector, but this is not absolutely necessary. If the normal
     * is a zero vector, the geometric object becomes equivalent to the straight line between the
     * two end points. The length of the normal sequence is exactly the same as for the {@linkplain
     * #getBulges bulge} sequence, 1 less than the control point sequence length.
     *
     * @return The sequence of normal vectors.
