    /**
     * Returns an ordered array of point values that lie on the {@linkplain CurveSegment curve
     * segment}. In most cases, these will be related to control points used in the construction of
     * the segment. The control points of a curve segment are use to control its shape, and are not
     * always on the curve segment itself. For example in a spline curve, the curve segment is given
     * as a weighted vector sum of the control points. Each weight function will have a maximum
     * within the constructive parameter interval, which will roughly correspond to the point on the
     * curve where it passes closest that the corresponding control point. These points, the values
     * of the curve at the maxima of the weight functions, will be the sample points for the curve
     * segment.
     *
     * @return The control points.
