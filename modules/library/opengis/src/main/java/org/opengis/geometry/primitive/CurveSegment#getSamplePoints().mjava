    /**
     * Returns an ordered array of point values that lie on the {@linkplain CurveSegment curve segment}.
     * In most cases, these will be related to control points used in the construction of the segment.
     * The control points of a curve segment are use to control its shape, and are not always on the
     * curve segment itself. For example in a spline curve, the curve segment is given as a weighted
     * vector sum of the control points. Each weight function will have a maximum within the
     * constructive parameter interval, which will roughly correspond to the point on the curve
     * where it passes closest that the corresponding control point. These points, the values of
     * the curve at the maxima of the weight functions, will be the sample points for the curve
     * segment.
     *
     * @return The control points.
