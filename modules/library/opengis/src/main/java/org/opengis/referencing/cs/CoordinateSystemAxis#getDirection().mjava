    /**
     * Direction of this coordinate system axis. In the case of Cartesian projected coordinates,
     * this is the direction of this coordinate system axis locally. Examples: {@linkplain
     * AxisDirection#NORTH north} or {@linkplain AxisDirection#SOUTH south}, {@linkplain
     * AxisDirection#EAST east} or {@linkplain AxisDirection#WEST west}, {@linkplain
     * AxisDirection#UP up} or {@linkplain AxisDirection#DOWN down}. Within any set of coordinate
     * system axes, only one of each pair of terms can be used. For earth-fixed coordinate reference
     * systems, this direction is often approximate and intended to provide a human interpretable
     * meaning to the axis. When a geodetic datum is used, the precise directions of the axes may
     * therefore vary slightly from this approximate direction.
     *
     * <p>Note that an {@link org.opengis.referencing.crs.EngineeringCRS} often requires specific
     * descriptions of the directions of its coordinate system axes.
     *
     * @return The coordinate system axis direction.
