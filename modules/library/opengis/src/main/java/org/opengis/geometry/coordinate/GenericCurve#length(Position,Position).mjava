     * Returns the length between two points. The length of a piece of curvilinear geometry shall be

     * accumulation of distance, its return value shall be in a unit of measure appropriate for
     * measuring distances. This method shall return the distance between the two points along the
     * curve. The default values of the two parameters shall be the start point and the end point,
     * respectively. If either of the points is not on the curve, then it shall be projected to the
     * nearest {@linkplain DirectPosition direct position} on the curve before the distance is
     * calculated. If the curve is not simple and passes through either of the two points more than
     * once, the distance shall be the minimal distance between the two points on this {@linkplain
     * org.opengis.geometry.primitive.Curve curve}.
