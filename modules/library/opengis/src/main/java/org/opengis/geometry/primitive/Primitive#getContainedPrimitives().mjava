     * Returns the {@code Primitive}s which are by definition coincident with this one. This allows
     * applications to override the {@link org.opengis.geometry.TransfiniteSet
     * TransfiniteSet&lt;DirectPosition&gt;} interpretation and its associated computational
     * geometry, and declare one {@code Primitive} to be "interior to" another.
     *
     * <p>This set should normally be empty when the {@code Primitive}s are within a {@linkplain
     * Complex complex}, since in that case the boundary information is sufficient for most cases.
     *
     * <p>This association should not be used when the two {@code Primitive}s are not close to one
     * another. The intent is to allow applications to compensate for inherent and unavoidable round
     * off, truncation, and other mathematical problems indigenous to computer calculations.
     *
     * @return The set of primitives contained into this primitive.
     * @todo Using a {@link Set} returns type allows the user to add or remove element in this set
     *     at his convenience. Is it the right interpretation of this specification?
