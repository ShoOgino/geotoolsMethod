     * Constructs a line string (sequence of line segments) where the control points (ends of
     * the segments) lie on this curve. If {@code maxSpacing} is given (not zero), then
     * the distance between control points along the generated curve shall be not more than
     * {@code maxSpacing}. If {@code maxOffset} is given (not zero), the distance
     * between generated curve at any point and the original curve shall not be more than the
     * {@code maxOffset}. If both parameters are set, then both criteria shall be met.
     * If the original control points of the curve lie on the curve, then they shall be included
     * in the returned {@linkplain LineString line string}'s control points. If both parameters are
     * set to zero, then the line string returned shall be constructed from the control points of the
     * original curve.

     * <strong>NOTE:</strong> This function is useful in creating linear approximations of the
     * curve for simple actions such as display. It is often referred to as a "stroked curve".
     * For this purpose, the {@code maxOffset} version is useful in maintaining a minimal
     * representation of the curve appropriate for the display device being targeted. This
     * function is also useful in preparing to transform a curve from one coordinate reference
     * system to another by transforming its control points. In this case, the
     * {@code maxSpacing} version is more appropriate. Allowing both parameters to default
     * to zero does not seem to have any useful geographic nor geometric interpretation unless
     * further information is known about how the curves were constructed.
