    /**
     * The ColorMap element defines either the colors of a palette-type raster
     * source or the mapping of  fixed-numeric pixel values to colors.  For
     * example, a DEM raster giving elevations in meters above sea level can
     * be translated to a colored  image with a ColorMap.  The quantity
     * attributes of a color-map are used for translating between numeric
     * matrixes and color rasters and the ColorMap entries should be in order
     * of increasing numeric quantity so  that intermediate numeric values can
     * be matched to a color (or be interpolated between two colors).   Labels
     * may be used for legends or may be used in the future to match character
     * values.   Not all systems can support opacity in colormaps.  The
     * default opacity is 1.0 (fully opaque).   Defaults for quantity and
     * label are system-dependent.
     *
     * @return the ColorMap for the raster
