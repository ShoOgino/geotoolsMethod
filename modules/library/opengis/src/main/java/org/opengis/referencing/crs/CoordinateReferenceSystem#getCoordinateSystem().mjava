     * Returns a relevant coordinate system instance. Special cases:
     *
     * <ul>
     *   <li>
     *       <p>If the CRS instance on which this method is invoked is an instance of the
     *       {@linkplain SingleCRS single CRS} interface, then the CS instance which is returned
     *       shall be one of the defined sub-interfaces of {@linkplain CoordinateSystem coordinate
     *       system}.
     *   <li>
     *       <p>If the CRS instance on which this method is invoked is an instance of the
     *       {@linkplain CompoundCRS compound CRS} interface, then the CS instance which is returned
     *       shall have dimension and axis components obtained from different {@linkplain
     *       CompoundCRS#getCoordinateReferenceSystems components} of the instance CRS.
     * </ul>
     *
     * @departure Strictly speaking, this method is defined by ISO 19111 for {@linkplain SingleCRS
     *     single CRS} only. GeoAPI declares this method in this parent interface for user
     *     convenience, since CS {@linkplain CoordinateSystem#getDimension dimension} and
     *     {@linkplain CoordinateSystem#getAxis axis} are commonly requested information and shall
     *     be available, directly or indirectly, in all cases (including {@linkplain CompoundCRS
     *     compound CRS}).
     * @return The coordinate system.
