     * Gets the derivative of this transform at a point. The derivative is the

     * the point.
     *
     * @param  point The coordinate point where to evaluate the derivative. Null value is
     *         accepted only if the derivative is the same everywhere. For example affine
     *         transform accept null value since they produces identical derivative no
     *         matter the coordinate value. But most map projection will requires a non-null
     *         value.
     * @return The derivative at the specified point as a 2&times;2 matrix.  This method
     *         never returns an internal object: changing the matrix will not change the
     *         state of this math transform.
     * @throws NullPointerException if the derivative dependents on coordinate
     *         and {@code point} is {@code null}.
     * @throws TransformException if the derivative can't be evaluated at the
     *         specified point.
