     * Gets the derivative of this transform at a point. The derivative is the matrix of the

     * @param point The coordinate point where to evaluate the derivative. Null value is accepted
     *     only if the derivative is the same everywhere. For example affine transform accept null
     *     value since they produces identical derivative no matter the coordinate value. But most
     *     map projection will requires a non-null value.
     * @return The derivative at the specified point as a 2&times;2 matrix. This method never
     *     returns an internal object: changing the matrix will not change the state of this math
     *     transform.
     * @throws NullPointerException if the derivative dependents on coordinate and {@code point} is
     *     {@code null}.
     * @throws TransformException if the derivative can't be evaluated at the specified point.
