     * this {@code Point} is defined. For example, in the Mercator projection, the curve is the
     * rhumb line. In 3D, geocentric coordinate system, the curve may be the geodesic joining the
     * two points along the surface of the geoid or ellipsoid in use. Implementations that support
     * this function shall specify the nature of the curve to be used.
