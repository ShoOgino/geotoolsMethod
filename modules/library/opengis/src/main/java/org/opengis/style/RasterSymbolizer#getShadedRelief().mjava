    /**
     * The ShadedRelief element selects the application of relief shading (or
     * ?hill shading?) to an image for  a three-dimensional visual effect.  It
     * is defined as: Exact parameters of the shading are system-dependent
     * (for now).  If the BrightnessOnly flag is ?0?  (false, default), the
     * shading is applied to the layer being rendered as the current
     * RasterSymbol. If BrightnessOnly is ?1? (true), the shading is applied
     * to the brightness of the colors in the rendering canvas generated so
     * far by other layers, with the effect of relief-shading these other
     * layers. The default for BrightnessOnly is ?0? (false).  The
     * ReliefFactor gives the amount of exaggeration to  use for the height of
     * the ?hills.?  A value of around 55 (times) gives reasonable results for
     * Earth-based DEMs. The default value is system-dependent.
