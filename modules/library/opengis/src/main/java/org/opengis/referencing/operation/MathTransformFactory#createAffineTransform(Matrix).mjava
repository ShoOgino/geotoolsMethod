     * Creates an affine transform from a matrix. If the transform's input dimension is {@code M},

     * in the matrix dimensions allows the matrix to do a shift, as well as a rotation. The {@code
     * [M][j]} element of the matrix will be the j'th ordinate of the moved origin. The {@code
     * [i][N]} element of the matrix will be 0 for <var>i</var> less than {@code M}, and 1 for
     * <var>i</var> equals {@code M}.

     * @param matrix The matrix used to define the affine transform.
     * @return The affine transform.
     * @throws FactoryException if the object creation failed.
