     * The transform which is applied to grid values for this sample dimension.
     * This transform is often defined as
     * <var>y</var> = {@linkplain #getOffset offset} + {@link #getScale scale}&times;<var>x</var> where
     * <var>x</var> is the grid value and <var>y</var> is the geophysics value.
     * However, this transform may also defines more complex relationship, for
     * example a logarithmic one. In order words, this transform is a generalization of
     * {@link #getScale}, {@link #getOffset} and {@link #getNoDataValues} methods.
     *
     * @return The transform from sample to geophysics values, or {@code null} if
     *         it doesn't apply.
     *
     * @see #getScale
