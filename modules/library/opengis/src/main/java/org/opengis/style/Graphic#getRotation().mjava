    /**
     * Returns the expression that will be used to calculate the rotation of the graphic when it is

     *
     * <p>The Rotation element gives the rotation of a graphic in the clockwise direction about its
     * center point in decimal degrees, encoded as a floating-point number. Negative values mean
     * counter-clockwise rotation. The default value is 0.0 (no rotation). Note that there is no
     * connection between source geometry types and rotations; the point used for plotting has no
     * inherent direction. Also, the point within the graphic about which it is rotated is format
     * dependent. If a format does not include an inherent rotation point, then the point of
     * rotation should be the centroid.
