     * parameter} and {@linkplain #getEndConstructiveParam end constructive parameter} of the
     * clothoid, then the curve goes through the clothoid's inflection point, and the direction of
     * its radius of curvature, given by the second derivative vector, changes sides with respect to
     * the tangent vector. The term "length" for the parameter {@code t} is applicable only in the
     * parameter space, and its relation to arc length after use of the placement, and with respect
     * to the coordinate reference system of the curve is not deterministic.
