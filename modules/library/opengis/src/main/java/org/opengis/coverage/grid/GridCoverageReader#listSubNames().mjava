     * Retrieve the list of grid coverages contained within the {@linkplain #getSource

     * each having a different projection. An empty array will be returned if no sub names
     * exist.
     *
     * @return The list of grid coverages contained within the input source.
     * @throws IOException if an error occurs during reading.
     *
     * @todo The javadoc should also be more explicit about hierarchical format.
     *       Should the names be returned as paths?
     *       Explain what to return if the GridCoverage are accessible by index
     *       only. A proposal is to name them "grid1", "grid2", etc.
     * @deprecated use {@link #getGridCoverageNames()}
