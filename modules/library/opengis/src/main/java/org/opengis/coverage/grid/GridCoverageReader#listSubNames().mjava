     * Retrieve the list of grid coverages contained within the {@linkplain #getSource input

     * geometry. For example, a HDF-EOS file (GRID.HDF) contains 6 grid coverages each having a
     * different projection. An empty array will be returned if no sub names exist.
     *
     * @return The list of grid coverages contained within the input source.
     * @throws IOException if an error occurs during reading.
     * @todo The javadoc should also be more explicit about hierarchical format. Should the names be
     *     returned as paths? Explain what to return if the GridCoverage are accessible by index
     *     only. A proposal is to name them "grid1", "grid2", etc.
     * @deprecated use {@link #getGridCoverageNames()}
