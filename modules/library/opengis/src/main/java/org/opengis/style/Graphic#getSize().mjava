     * The Size element gives the absolute size of the graphic in uoms encoded as a floating- point
     * number. The default size for an object is context-dependent. Negative values are not allowed.
     * The default size of an image format (such as GIF) is the inherent size of the image. The
     * default size of a format without an inherent size (such as SVG which are not specially
     * marked) is defined to be 16 pixels in height and the corresponding aspect in width. If a size
     * is specified, the height of the graphic will be scaled to that size and the corresponding
     * aspect will be used for the width. An expected common use case will be for image graphics to
     * be on the order of 200 pixels in linear size and to be scaled to lower sizes. On systems that
     * can resample these graphic images "smoothly," the results will be visually pleasing.
