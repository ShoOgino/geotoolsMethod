    /**
     * The AnchorPoint element of a PointSymbolizer gives the location inside of a Graphic
     * (or label - see 11.4.4) to use for anchoring the graphic to the main-geometry point. The
     * coordinates are given as two floating-point numbers in the AnchorPointX and
     * AnchorPointY elements each with values between 0.0 and 1.0 inclusive. The bounding
     * box of the graphic/label to be rendered is considered to be in a coordinate space from 0.0
     * (lower-left corner) to 1.0 (upper-right corner), and the anchor position is specified as a
     * point in this space. The default point is X=0.5, Y=0.5, which is at the middle height and
     * middle length of the graphic/label text. A system may choose different anchor points to
     * de-conflict graphics/labels.
     *
     * @return AnchorPoint , if null should use a default point X=0.5 Y=0.5
