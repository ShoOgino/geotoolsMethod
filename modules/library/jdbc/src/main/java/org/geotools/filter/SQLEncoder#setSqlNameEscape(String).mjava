     * Sets the SQL name escape string.
     * 
     * <p>
     * The value of this string is prefixed and appended to table schema names,
     * table names and column names in an SQL statement to support mixed-case
     * and non-English names. Without this, the DBMS may assume a mixed-case
     * name in the query should be treated as upper-case and an SQLCODE of
     * -204 or 206 may result if the name is not found.
     * </p>
     * 
     * <p>
     * Typically this is the double-quote character, ", but may not be for all
     * databases.
     * </p>
     * 
     * <p>
     * For example, consider the following query:
     * </p>
     * 
     * <p>
     * SELECT Geom FROM Spear.ArchSites May be interpreted by the database as:
     * SELECT GEOM FROM SPEAR.ARCHSITES  If the column and table names were
     * actually created using mixed-case, the query needs to be specified as:
     * SELECT "Geom" from "Spear"."ArchSites"
     * </p>
     *
     * @param escape the character to be used to escape database names
