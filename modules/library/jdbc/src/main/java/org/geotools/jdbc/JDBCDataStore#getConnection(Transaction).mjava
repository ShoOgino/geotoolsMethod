    /**
     * Returns a JDBC Connection to the underlying database for the specified GeoTools {@link
     * Transaction}. This has two main use cases:
     *
     * <ul>
     *   <li>Independently accessing the underlying database directly reusing the connection pool
     *       contained in the {@link JDBCDataStore}
     *   <li>Performing some direct access to the database in the same JDBC transaction as the
     *       Geotools code
     * </ul>
     *
     * The connection shall be used in a different way depending on the use case:
     *
     * <ul>
     *   <li>If the transaction is {@link Transaction#AUTO_COMMIT} or if the transaction is not
     *       shared with this data store and originating {@link FeatureStore} objects it is the duty
     *       of the caller to properly close the connection after usage, failure to do so will
     *       result in the connection pool loose one available connection permanently
     *   <li>If the transaction is on the other side a valid transaction is shared with Geotools the
     *       client code should refrain from closing the connection, committing or rolling back, and
     *       use the {@link Transaction} facilities to do so instead
     * </ul>
     *
     * @param t The GeoTools transaction. Can be {@code null}, in that case a new connection will be
     *     returned (as if {@link Transaction#AUTO_COMMIT} was provided)
