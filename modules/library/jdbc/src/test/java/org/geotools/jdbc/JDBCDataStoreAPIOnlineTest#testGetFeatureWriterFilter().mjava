     * Test for FeatureWriter getFeatureWriter(String, boolean, Transaction) @task REVISIT:
     * JDBCDataStore currently does not return these proper instanceof's. If we want to guarantee
     * that people can't append to a request with a FeatureWriter then we could add the
     * functionality to JDBCDataStore by having getFeatureWriter(.. Filter ...) check to see if the
     * FeatureWriter returned is instanceof FilteringFeatureWriter, and if not then just wrap it in
     * a FilteringFeatureWriter(writer, Filter.INCLUDE). I think it'd be a bit of unnecessary
     * overhead, but if we want it it's easy to do. It will guarantee that calls with Filter won't
     * ever append. Doing with Filter.INCLUDE, however, would require a bit of reworking, as the
     * Filter getFeatureWriter is currently where we do the bulk of the work.
