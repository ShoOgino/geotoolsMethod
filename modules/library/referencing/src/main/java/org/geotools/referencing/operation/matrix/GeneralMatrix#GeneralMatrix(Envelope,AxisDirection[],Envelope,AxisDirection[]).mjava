    /**
     * Constructs a transform mapping a source region to a destination region. Axis order and/or
     * direction can be changed during the process. For example, the transform may convert
     * (NORTH,WEST) coordinates into (EAST,NORTH). Axis direction can be inversed only. For example,
     * it is illegal to transform (NORTH,WEST) coordinates into (NORTH,DOWN).
     *
     * <p>If the source dimension is equals to the destination dimension, then the transform is
     * affine. However, the following special cases are also handled: <br>
     *
     * <UL>
     *   <LI>If the target dimension is smaller than the source dimension, extra axis are dropped.
     *       An exception is thrown if the target contains some axis not found in the source.
     * </UL>
     *
     * @param srcRegion The source region.
     * @param srcAxis Axis direction for each dimension of the source region.
     * @param dstRegion The destination region.
     * @param dstAxis Axis direction for each dimension of the destination region.
     * @throws MismatchedDimensionException if the envelope dimension doesn't matches the axis
     *     direction array length.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException If {@code dstAxis} contains some axis not found in {@code
     *     srcAxis}, or if some colinear axis were found.
