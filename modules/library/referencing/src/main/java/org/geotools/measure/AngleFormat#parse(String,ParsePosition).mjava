     * Parses a string as an angle. This method can parse an angle even if it doesn't comply exactly
     * to the expected pattern. For example, this method will parse correctly string "<code>
     * 48Â°12.34'</code>" even if the expected pattern was "{@code DDMM.mm}" (i.e. the string should
     * have been "{@code 4812.34}"). Spaces between degrees, minutes and secondes are ignored. If
     * the string ends with an hemisphere symbol "N" or "S", then this method returns an object of
     * class {@link Latitude}. Otherwise, if the string ends with an hemisphere symbol "E" or "W",
     * then this method returns an object of class {@link Longitude}. Otherwise, this method returns
     * an object of class {@link Angle}.
     *
     * @param source A String whose beginning should be parsed.
     * @param pos Position where to start parsing.
     * @return The parsed string as an {@link Angle}, {@link Latitude} or {@link Longitude} object.
