    /**
     * Returns an operation for conversion or transformation between two coordinate reference
     * systems. The default implementation extracts the authority code from the supplied {@code
     * sourceCRS} and {@code targetCRS}, and submit them to the <code>
     * {@linkplain CoordinateOperationAuthorityFactory#createFromCoordinateReferenceSystemCodes
     * createFromCoordinateReferenceSystemCodes}(sourceCode, targetCode)</code> methods. If no
     * operation is found for those codes, then this method returns {@code null}.
     *
     * <p>Note that this method may be invoked recursively. For example no operation may be
     * available from the {@linkplain #getAuthorityFactory underlying authority factory} between two
     * {@linkplain org.opengis.referencing.crs.CompoundCRS compound CRS}, but an operation may be
     * available between two components of those compound CRS.
     *
     * @param sourceCRS Input coordinate reference system.
     * @param targetCRS Output coordinate reference system.
     * @return A coordinate operation from {@code sourceCRS} to {@code targetCRS}, or {@code null}
     *     if no such operation is explicitly defined in the underlying database.
     * @since 2.3
