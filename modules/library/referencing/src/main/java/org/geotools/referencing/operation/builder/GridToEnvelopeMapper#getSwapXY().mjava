     * Returns {@code true} if the two first axis should be interchanged. If <code>

     * (which is the default), then this method make the following assumptions:
     *
     * <ul>
     *   <li>
     *       <p>Axis order in the grid range matches exactly axis order in the envelope, except for
     *       the special case described in the next point. In other words, if axis order in the
     *       underlying image is (<var>column</var>, <var>row</var>) (which is the case for a
     *       majority of images), then the envelope should probably have a (<var>longitude</var>,
     *       <var>latitude</var>) or (<var>easting</var>, <var>northing</var>) axis order.
     *   <li>
     *       <p>An exception to the above rule applies for CRS using exactly the following axis
     *       order: ({@link AxisDirection#NORTH NORTH}|{@link AxisDirection#SOUTH SOUTH}, {@link
     *       AxisDirection#EAST EAST}|{@link AxisDirection#WEST WEST}). An example of such CRS is
     *       {@code EPSG:4326}. In this particular case, this method will returns {@code true}, thus
     *       suggesting to interchange the (<var>y</var>,<var>x</var>) axis for such CRS.
     * </ul>
     *
     * @return {@code true} if the two first axis should be interchanged.
