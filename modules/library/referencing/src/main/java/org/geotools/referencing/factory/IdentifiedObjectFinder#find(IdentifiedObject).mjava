     *       are used for {@linkplain AuthorityFactory#createObject creating objects} to be tested.
     *   <li>If the authority factory can create objects from their {@linkplain
     *       IdentifiedObject#getName name} in addition of identifiers, then the name and
     *       {@linkplain IdentifiedObject#getAlias aliases} are used for creating objects to be
     *       tested.
     *   <li>If {@linkplain #isFullScanAllowed full scan is allowed}, then full {@linkplain
     *       #getCodeCandidates set of authority codes} are used for creating objects to be tested.
     * </ul>

     * sense of {@link CRS#equalsIgnoreMetadata equalsIgnoreMetadata} is returned.
