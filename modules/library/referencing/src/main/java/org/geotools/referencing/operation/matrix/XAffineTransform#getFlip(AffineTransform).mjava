    /**
     * Returns {@code -1} if one axis has been flipped, {@code +1} if no axis has been flipped, or 0
     * if unknown. A flipped axis in an axis with direction reversed (typically the <var>y</var>
     * axis). This method assumes that the specified affine transform is built from arbitrary
     * translations, scales or rotations, but no shear. Note that it is not possible to determine
     * which of the <var>x</var> or <var>y</var> axis has been flipped.
     *
     * <p>This method can be used in order to set the sign of a scale according the flipping state.
     * The example below choose to apply the sign on the <var>y</var> scale, but this is an
     * arbitrary (while common) choice:
     *
     * <blockquote>
     *
     * <code>
     * double scaleX0 = getScaleX0(transform);
     * double scaleY0 = getScaleY0(transform);
     * int    flip    = getFlip(transform);
     * if (flip != 0) {
     *     scaleY0 *= flip;
     *     // ... continue the process here.
     * }
     * </code>
     *
     * </blockquote>
     *
     * This method is similar to the following code, except that this method distinguish between
     * "unflipped" and "unknow" states.
     *
     * <blockquote>
     *
     * <code>
     * boolean flipped = (tr.{@linkplain #getType() getType()} & {@linkplain #TYPE_FLIP}) != 0;
     * </code>
     *
     * </blockquote>
