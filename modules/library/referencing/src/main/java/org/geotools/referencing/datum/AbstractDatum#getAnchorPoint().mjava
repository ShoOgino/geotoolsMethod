    /**
     * Description, possibly including coordinates, of the point or points used to anchor the datum
     * to the Earth. Also known as the "origin", especially for Engineering and Image Datums.
     *
     * <ul>
     *   <li>For a geodetic datum, this point is also known as the fundamental point, which is
     *       traditionally the point where the relationship between geoid and ellipsoid is defined.
     *       In some cases, the "fundamental point" may consist of a number of points. In those
     *       cases, the parameters defining the geoid/ellipsoid relationship have then been averaged
     *       for these points, and the averages adopted as the datum definition.
     *   <li>For an engineering datum, the anchor point may be a physical point, or it may be a
     *       point with defined coordinates in another CRS.
     *   <li>For an image datum, the anchor point is usually either the centre of the image or the
     *       corner of the image.
     *   <li>For a temporal datum, this attribute is not defined. Instead of the anchor point, a
     *       temporal datum carries a separate time origin of type {@link Date}.
     * </ul>
