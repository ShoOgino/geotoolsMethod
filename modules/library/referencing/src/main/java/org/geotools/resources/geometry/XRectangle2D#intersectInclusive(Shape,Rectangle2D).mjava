     * the rectangle and the shape intersect, but the calculations to accurately determine this
     * intersection are prohibitively expensive. This is similar to {@link

     * {@linkplain Rectangle2D#getWidth width} or {@linkplain Rectangle2D#getHeight height} (which
     * are {@linkplain Rectangle2D#isEmpty empty} according {@link Shape} contract). However,
     * rectangle with negative width or height are still considered as empty. <br>
     * <br>
     * This method is said <cite>inclusive</cite> because it try to mimic {@link
     * #intersectInclusive(Rectangle2D, Rectangle2D)} behavior, at least for rectangle with zero
     * width or height.
