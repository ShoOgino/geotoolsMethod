    /**
     * Removes every {@code *_AUTHORITY_FACTORY} hints except the specified one. The removal, if
     * needed, is performed in a copy of the supplied hints in order to keep user's map unmodified.
     *
     * <p>This removal is performed because {@code *_AUTHORITY_FACTORY} hints are typically supplied
     * to the above constructor in order to initialize the {@link #crsFactory}, {@link #csFactory},
     * <cite>etc.</cite> fields. But because the same map of hints is used for every call to {@code
     * ReferencingFactoryFinder.getFooAuthorityFactory(...)}, if we don't perform this removal, then
     * the {@code CRS_AUTHORITY_FACTORY} hint is taken in account for fetching other factories like
     * {@link CSAuthorityFactory}. We may think that it is not a problem since CS authority factory
     * should not care about {@code CRS_AUTHORITY_FACTORY} hint. But... our EPSG authority factory
     * implements both {@link CRSAuthorityFactory} and {@link CSAuthorityFactory} interfaces, so our
     * {@link CSAuthorityFactory} implementation do have CRS-related hints.
     *
     * <p>Conclusion: if we do not remove those hints, it typically leads to failure to find a CS
     * authority factory using this specific CRS authority factory. We may argue that this is a
     * Geotools design problem. Maybe... this is not a trivial issue. So we are better to not
     * document that in public API for now.
     *
     * @param userHints The user hints to trim. This map will never be modified.
     * @param keep The hint to <strong>not</strong> remove.
     * @return A copy of {@code userHints} without the authority hints, or {@code userHints} if no
     *     change were required.
