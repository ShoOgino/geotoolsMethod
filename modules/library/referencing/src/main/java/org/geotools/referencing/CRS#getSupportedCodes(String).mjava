    /**
     * Get the list of the codes that are supported by the given authority. For example {@code
     * getSupportedCodes("EPSG")} may returns {@code "EPSG:2000"}, {@code "EPSG:2001"}, {@code
     * "EPSG:2002"}, <cite>etc</cite>. It may also returns {@code "2000"}, {@code "2001"}, {@code
     * "2002"}, <cite>etc.</cite> without the {@code "EPSG:"} prefix. Whatever the authority name is
     * prefixed or not is factory implementation dependent.
     *
     * <p>If there is more than one factory for the given authority, then this method merges the
     * code set of all of them. If a factory fails to provide a set of supported code, then this
     * particular factory is ignored. Please be aware of the following potential issues:
     *
     * <p>
     *
     * <ul>
     *   <li>If there is more than one EPSG databases (for example an {@linkplain
     *       org.geotools.referencing.factory.epsg.AccessDataSource Access} and a {@linkplain
     *       org.geotools.referencing.factory.epsg.PostgreDataSource PostgreSQL} ones), then this
     *       method will connect to all of them even if their content are identical.
     *   <li>If two factories format their codes differently (e.g. {@code "4326"} and {@code
     *       "EPSG:4326"}), then the returned set will contain a lot of synonymous codes.
     *   <li>For any code <var>c</var> in the returned set, there is no warranty that <code>
     *       {@linkplain #decode decode}(c)</code> will use the same authority factory than the one
     *       that formatted <var>c</var>.
     *   <li>This method doesn't report connection problems since it doesn't throw any exception.
     *       {@link FactoryException}s are logged as warnings and otherwise ignored.
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>If a more determinist behavior is wanted, consider the code below instead. The following
     * code exploit only one factory, the "preferred" one.
     *
     * <blockquote>
     *
     * <code>
     * {@linkplain CRSAuthorityFactory} factory = FactoryFinder.{@linkplain
     * ReferencingFactoryFinder#getCRSAuthorityFactory getCRSAuthorityFactory}(authority, null);<br>
     * Set&lt;String&gt; codes = factory.{@linkplain CRSAuthorityFactory#getAuthorityCodes
     * getAuthorityCodes}(CoordinateReferenceSystem.class);<br>
     * String code = <cite>...choose a code here...</cite><br>
     * {@linkplain CoordinateReferenceSystem} crs = factory.createCoordinateReferenceSystem(code);
     * </code>
     *
     * </blockquote>
     *
     * @param authority The authority name (for example {@code "EPSG"}).
     * @return The set of supported codes. May be empty, but never null.
