     * connection. Each featurereader has an ArcSDE stream opened until its <code>close()</code>
     * method is called or hasNext() returns flase, wich automatically closes the stream. If more
     * than 24 simultaneous streams are tryied to be opened upon a single SeConnection, an exception
     * is thrown by de Java ArcSDE API saying that a "NETWORK I/O OPERATION FAILED"
