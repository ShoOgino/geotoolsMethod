     * Constructor for the {@link GrassCoverageReader}.
     *
     * @param cellAnchor the object defining whether to assume the pixel value to be read in the
     *     grid's cell corner or center.
     * @param interpolation the type of interpolation to be used in the case some scaling or padding
     *     has to be done.
     * @param useSubSamplingAsColsRows a flag that gives the possibility to bypass the imageio
     *     subsampling mechanism. With GRASS maps this is often more performant in some boundary
     *     situations. In the case this flag is set to true, the subsampling values will be handled
     *     as the requested columns and rows.
     * @param castDoubleToFloating a flag that gives the possibility to force the reading of a map
     *     as a floating point map. This is necessary right now because of a imageio bug:
     *     https://jai-imageio-core.dev.java.net /issues/show_bug.cgi?id=180.
     * @param monitor a {@link IHMProgressMonitor monitor} for logging purposes. This can be null,
     *     in which case a dummy one will be used.
