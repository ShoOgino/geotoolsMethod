	 * Identification of, and means of communication with, person(s) responsible for the resource(s).
	 * For OWS use in the ServiceProvider section of a service metadata document, the optional organizationName element was removed, since this type is always used with the ProviderName element which provides that information. The optional individualName element was made mandatory, since either the organizationName or individualName element is mandatory. The mandatory "role" element was changed to optional, since no clear use of this information is known in the ServiceProvider section.
