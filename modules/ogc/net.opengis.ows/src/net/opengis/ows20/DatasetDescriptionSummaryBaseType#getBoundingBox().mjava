   * Unordered list of zero or more minimum bounding
   *               rectangles surrounding coverage data, in AvailableCRSs. Zero or
   *               more BoundingBoxes are allowed in addition to one or more
   *               WGS84BoundingBoxes to allow more precise specification of the
   *               Dataset area in AvailableCRSs. These Bounding Boxes shall not
   *               use any CRS not listed as an AvailableCRS. However, an
   *               AvailableCRS can be listed without a corresponding Bounding Box.
   *               If no such bounding box is recorded for a coverage, any such
   *               bounding boxes recorded for a higher level in a hierarchy of
   *               datasets shall apply to this coverage. If such bounding box(es)
   *               are recorded for a coverage, any such bounding boxes recorded
   *               for a higher level in a hierarchy of datasets shall be ignored.
   *               If multiple bounding boxes are included with the same CRS, this
   *               shall be interpreted as the union of the areas of these bounding
   *               boxes.
