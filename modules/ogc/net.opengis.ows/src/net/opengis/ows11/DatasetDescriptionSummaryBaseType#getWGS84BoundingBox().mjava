     * Unordered list of zero or more minimum bounding rectangles surrounding coverage data, using the WGS 84 CRS with decimal degrees and longitude before latitude. If no WGS 84 bounding box is recorded for a coverage, any such bounding boxes recorded for a higher level in a hierarchy of datasets shall apply to this coverage. If WGS 84 bounding box(es) are recorded for a coverage, any such bounding boxes recorded for a higher level in a hierarchy of datasets shall be ignored. For each lowest-level coverage in a hierarchy, at least one applicable WGS84BoundingBox shall be either recorded or inherited, to simplify searching for datasets that might overlap a specified region. If multiple WGS 84 bounding boxes are included, this shall be interpreted as the union of the areas of these bounding boxes.
