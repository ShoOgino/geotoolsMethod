     * Unordered list of zero or more minimum bounding rectangles surrounding coverage data, in AvailableCRSs.  Zero or more BoundingBoxes are  allowed in addition to one or more WGS84BoundingBoxes to allow more precise specification of the Dataset area in AvailableCRSs. These Bounding Boxes shall not use any CRS not listed as an AvailableCRS. However, an AvailableCRS can be listed without a corresponding Bounding Box. If no such bounding box is recorded for a coverage, any such bounding boxes recorded for a higher level in a hierarchy of datasets shall apply to this coverage. If such bounding box(es) are recorded for a coverage, any such bounding boxes recorded for a higher level in a hierarchy of datasets shall be ignored. If multiple bounding boxes are included with the same CRS, this shall be interpreted as the union of the areas of these bounding boxes.
