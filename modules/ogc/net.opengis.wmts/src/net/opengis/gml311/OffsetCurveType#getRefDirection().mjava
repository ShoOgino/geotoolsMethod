     * refDistance is used to define the vector
     *        direction of the offset curve from the basis curve. It can
     *        be omitted in the 2D case, where the distance can be 
     *        positive or negative. In that case, distance defines left
     *        side (positive distance) or right side (negative distance)
     *        with respect to the tangent to the basis curve.
     * 
     *        In 3D the basis curve shall have a well defined tangent 
     *        direction for every point. The offset curve at any point 
     *        in 3D, the basis curve shall have a well-defined tangent
     *        direction for every point. The offset curve at any point
     *        (parameter) on the basis curve c is in the direction
     *        -   -   -         -               
     *        s = v x t  where  v = c.refDirection()  
     *        and
     *        -
     *        t = c.tangent()
     *                                                     -
     *        For the offset direction to be well-defined, v shall not
     *        on any point of the curve be in the same, or opposite, 
     *        direction as
     *        - 
     *        t.
     * 
     *        The default value of the refDirection shall be the local
     *        co-ordinate axis vector for elevation, which indicates up for
     *        the curve in a geographic sense.
     * 
     *        NOTE! If the refDirection is the positive tangent to the
     *        local elevation axis ("points upward"), then the offset
     *        vector points to the left of the curve when viewed from
     *        above.
