	 * CoverageOfferings is the virtual document that a WCS offers. It consists of service metadata and a set of offered coverages. The CoverageOfferings element is never delivered to the client, however, responses of WCS requests are composed of constituents of the CoverageOfferings tree. Hence, CoverageOfferings serves to define responses.
