	 * An OfferedCoverage is the information set about a specific coverage offered by the WCS service on hand. It consists of a coverage, as defined in the GML Application Schema for Coverages [OGC 09-146r2] and coverage specific service parameters. Like CoverageOfferings, an OfferedCoverage element is never delivered to the client, but defines the response of coverage access requests.
