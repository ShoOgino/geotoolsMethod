	/**
   * Returns the value of the '<em><b>Release Action</b></em>' attribute.
   * The default value is <code>"ALL"</code>.
   * The literals are from the enumeration {@link net.opengis.wfs.AllSomeType}.
   * <!-- begin-user-doc -->
	 * <!-- end-user-doc -->
   * <!-- begin-model-doc -->
   * 
   *                      The releaseAction attribute is used to control how a Web
   *                      Feature service releases locks on feature instances after
   *                      a Transaction request has been processed.
   * 
   *                      Valid values are ALL or SOME.
   * 
   *                      A value of ALL means that the Web Feature Service should
   *                      release the locks of all feature instances locked with the
   *                      specified lockId regardless or whether or not the features
   *                      were actually modified.
   * 
   *                      A value of SOME means that the Web Feature Service will
   *                      only release the locks held on feature instances that
   *                      were actually operated upon by the transaction.  The
   *                      lockId that the client application obtained shall remain
   *                      valid and the other, unmodified, feature instances shall
   *                      remain locked.
   * 
   *                      If the expiry attribute was specified in the original
   *                      operation that locked the feature instances, then the
   *                      expiry counter will be reset to give the client
   *                      application that same amount of time to post subsequent
   *                      transactions against the locked features.
