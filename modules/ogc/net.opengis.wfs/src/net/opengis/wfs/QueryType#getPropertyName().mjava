	 *                    The Property element is used to specify one or more
	 *                    properties of a feature whose values are to be retrieved
	 *                    by a Web Feature Service.
	 * 
	 *                    While a Web Feature Service should endeavour to satisfy
	 *                    the exact request specified, in some instance this may
	 *                    not be possible.  Specifically, a Web Feature Service
	 *                    must generate a valid GML3 response to a Query operation.
	 *                    The schema used to generate the output may include
	 *                    properties that are mandatory.  In order that the output
	 *                    validates, these mandatory properties must be specified
	 *                    in the request.  If they are not, a Web Feature Service
	 *                    may add them automatically to the Query before processing
	 *                    it.  Thus a client application should, in general, be
	 *                    prepared to receive more properties than it requested.
	 * 
	 *                    Of course, using the DescribeFeatureType request, a client
	 *                    application can determine which properties are mandatory
	 *                    and request them in the first place.
