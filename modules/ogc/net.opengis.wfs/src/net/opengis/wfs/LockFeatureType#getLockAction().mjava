	/**
     * Returns the value of the '<em><b>Lock Action</b></em>' attribute.
     * The default value is <code>"ALL"</code>.
     * The literals are from the enumeration {@link net.opengis.wfs.AllSomeType}.

     * <!-- begin-model-doc -->
     * 
     *                      The lockAction attribute is used to indicate what
     *                      a Web Feature Service should do when it encounters
     *                      a feature instance that has already been locked by
     *                      another client application.
     * 
     *                      Valid values are ALL or SOME.
     * 
     *                      ALL means that the Web Feature Service must acquire
     *                      locks on all the requested feature instances.  If it
     *                      cannot acquire those locks then the request should
     *                      fail.  In this instance, all locks acquired by the
     *                      operation should be released.
     * 
     *                      SOME means that the Web Feature Service should lock
     *                      as many of the requested features as it can.
