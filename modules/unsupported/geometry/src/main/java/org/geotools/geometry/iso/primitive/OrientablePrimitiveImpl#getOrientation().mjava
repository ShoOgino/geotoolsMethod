	/**
	 * Orientable primitives are often denoted by a sign (for the orientation)
	 * and a base geometry (curve or surface). The sign datatype is defined in
	 * ISO 19103. If "c" is a curve, then "<+, c>" is its positive orientable
	 * curve and "<-, c>" is its negative orientable curve. In most cases,
	 * leaving out the syntax for record "< , >" does not lead to confusion, so "<+,
	 * c>" may be written as "+c" or simply "c", and "<-, c>" as "-c". Curve
	 * space arithmetic can be performed if the curves align properly, so that:
	 * 
	 * For c, d : OrientableCurves such that c.endPoint = d.startPoint then
	 *  ( c + d ) ==: CompositeCurve = < c, d >
	 * 
	 * @return 1 if positive and -1 if negative
