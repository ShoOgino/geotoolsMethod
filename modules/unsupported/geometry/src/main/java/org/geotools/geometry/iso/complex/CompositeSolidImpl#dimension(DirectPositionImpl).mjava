	/**
	 * The method <code>dimension</code> returns the inherent dimension of
	 * this Object, which is less than or equal to the coordinate dimension. The
	 * dimension of a collection of geometric objects is the largest dimension
	 * of any of its pieces. Points are 0-dimensional, curves are 1-dimensional,
	 * surfaces are 2-dimensional, and solids are 3-dimensional. Locally, the
	 * dimension of a geometric object at a point is the dimension of a local
	 * neighborhood of the point - that is the dimension of any coordinate
	 * neighborhood of the point. Dimension is unambiguously defined only for
	 * DirectPositions interior to this Object. If the passed DirectPosition2D
	 * is NULL, then the method returns the largest possible dimension for any
	 * DirectPosition2D in this Object.
	 * 
	 * @param point
	 *            a <code>DirectPosition2D</code> value
	 * @return an <code>int</code> value
