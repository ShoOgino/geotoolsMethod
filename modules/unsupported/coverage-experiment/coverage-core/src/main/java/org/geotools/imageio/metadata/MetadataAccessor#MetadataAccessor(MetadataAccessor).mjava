     * Creates an accessor with the same parent and childs than the specified

     * change in one accessor will be immediately reflected in the other
     * accessor. However each accessor can
     * {@linkplain #selectChild select their child} independently.
     * <p>
     * The main purpose of this constructor is to create many views over the
     * same list of childs, where each view {@linkplain #selectChild select} a
     * different child.
