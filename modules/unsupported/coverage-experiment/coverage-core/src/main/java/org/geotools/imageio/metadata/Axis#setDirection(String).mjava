     * Sets the direction for this {@link Axis} axis. Direction of this
     * coordinate system axis (or in the case of Cartesian projected
     * coordinates, the direction of this coordinate system axis locally).
     * Examples: north or south, east or west, up or down. Within any set of
     * coordinate system axes, only one of each pair of terms can be used. For
     * earth-fixed CRSs, this direction is often approximate and intended to
     * provide a human interpretable meaning to the axis. When a geodetic datum
     * is used, the precise directions of the axes may therefore vary slightly
     * from this approximate direction. Note that an EngineeringCRS often
     * requires specific descriptions of the directions of its coordinate system
     * axes.
     * 
     * @param direction
     *                The axis direction, or {@code null} if none.
