     * <p>
     * Type of a vertical datum.
     * <ul>
     * <li>Geoidal: The zero value of the associated vertical coordinate system
     * axis is defined to approximate a constant potential surface, usually the
     * geoid. Such a reference surface is usually determined by a national or
     * scientific authority, and is then a well-known, named datum.</li>
     * <li>Depth: The zero point of the vertical axis is defined by a surface
     * that has meaning for the purpose which the associated vertical
     * measurements are used for. For hydrographic charts, this is often a
     * predicted nominal sea surface (i.e., without waves or other wind and
     * current effects) that occurs at low tide.</li>
     * <li>Barometric: Atmospheric pressure is the basis for the definition of
     * the origin of the associated vertical coordinate system axis.</li>
     * <li>Other surface: In some cases, e.g. oil exploration and production, a
     * geological feature, such as the top or bottom of a geologically
     * identifiable and meaningful subsurface layer, is used as a vertical
     * datum. Other variations to the above three vertical datum types may exist
     * and are all included in this type.</li>
