     * Check if the envelope corresponds to full extent. It will probably not
     * equal the full extent envelope because of slack space in the display
     * area, so we check that at least one pair of opposite edges are
     * equal to the full extent envelope, allowing for slack space on the
     * other two sides.
     * <p>
     * Note: this method returns {@code false} if the full extent envelope
     * is wholly within the requested envelope (e.g. user has zoomed out
     * from full extent), only touches one edge, or touches two adjacent edges.
     * In all these cases we assume that the user wants to maintain the slack
     * space in the display.
     * <p>
     * This method is part of the work-around that the map pane needs because
     * of the differences in how raster and vector layers are treated by the
     * renderer classes.
     *
     * @param envelope a pending display envelope to compare to the full extent
     *        envelope
     *
     * @return true if the envelope is coincident with the full extent evenlope
     *         on at least two edges; false otherwise
     *
     * @todo My logic here seems overly complex - I'm sure there must be a simpler
     *       way for the map pane to handle this.
