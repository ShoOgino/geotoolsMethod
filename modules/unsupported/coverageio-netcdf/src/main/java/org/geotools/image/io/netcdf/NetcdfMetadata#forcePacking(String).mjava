     * Returns {@code true} if an attribute (usually the <cite>valid range</cite>) should be
     * converted from unpacked to packed units. The <A HREF="http://www.cfconventions.org/">CF
     * Metadata conventions</A> states that valid ranges should be in packed units, but not
     * every NetCDF files follow this advice in practice. The UCAR NetCDF library applies the
     * following heuristic rules (quoting from {@link ucar.nc2.dataset.EnhanceScaleMissing}):
     *
     * <blockquote>
     * If {@code valid_range} is the same type as {@code scale_factor} (actually the wider of
     * {@code scale_factor} and {@code add_offset}) and this is wider than the external data,
     * then it will be interpreted as being in the units of the internal (unpacked) data.
     * Otherwise it is in the units of the external (packed) data.
     * <blockquote>
     *
     * However some NetCDF files stores unpacked ranges using the same type than packed data.
     * The above cited heuristic rule can not resolve those cases.
     * <p>
     * If this method returns {@code true}, then the attribute is assumed in unpacked units no
     * matter what the CF convention and the heuristic rules said. If this method returns
     * {@code false}, then UCAR's heuristic rules applies.
     * <p>
     * The default implementation returns {@code false} in all cases.
