     * Creates a tile for the given region with default subsampling. This constructor is

     *
     * @param provider
     *          The image reader provider to use. The same provider is typically given to every
     *          {@code Tile} objects to be given to the same {@link TileManager} instance, but
     *          this is not mandatory. If {@code null}, the provider will be inferred from the
     *          input. If it can't be inferred, then an exception is thrown.
     * @param input
     *          The input to be given to the image reader.
     * @param imageIndex
     *          The image index to be given to the image reader for reading this tile.
     * @param region
     *          The region in the destination image. The {@linkplain Rectangle#width width} and
     *          {@linkplain Rectangle#height height} should match the image size.
     *
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException
     *          If a required argument is {@code null} or some argument has an invalid value.
