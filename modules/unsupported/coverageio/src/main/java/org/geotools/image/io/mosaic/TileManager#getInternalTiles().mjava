     * the fly (as {@link GridTileManager} can do). This is because we want to update the state of
     * those tiles in a persistent way if this method is invoked by {@link #setGridToCRS}.
     * <p>
     * Callers of this method should not rely on the {@linkplain Tile#getInput tile input} and
     * should not attempt to read the tiles, since the inputs can be non-existant files or patterns
     * (again the case of {@link GridTileManager}). This method is not public for that reason.
     * <p>
     * The default implementation returns {@link #getTiles}.
     *
     * @return The internal tiles. If the returned collection is an instance of
     *         {@link FrequencySortedSet}, then the frequencies will be honored
     *         in methods where it matter like {@link #getImageReaderSpis}.
     * @throws IOException If an I/O operation was required and failed.
