    /**
     * 
     * Optional enum. One of map, viewport, auto. Defaults to auto. Requires text-field. In combination with symbol-placement, determines the rotation
     * behavior of the individual glyphs forming the text.
     * 
     * Possible values:
     * 
     * {@link Alignment#MAP} When symbol-placement is set to point, aligns text east-west. When symbol-placement is set to line, aligns text x-axes
     * with the line.
     * 
     * {@link Alignment#VIEWPORT} Produces glyphs whose x-axes are aligned with the x-axis of the viewport, regardless of the value of
     * symbol-placement.
     * 
     * {@link Alignment#AUTO} When symbol-placement is set to point, this is equivalent to viewport. When symbol-placement is set to line, this is
     * equivalent to map.
