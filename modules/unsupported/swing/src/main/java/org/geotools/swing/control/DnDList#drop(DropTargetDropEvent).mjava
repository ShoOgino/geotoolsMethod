    /**
     * Handles the moving (for drag and drop actions within this list) or transfer (for actions
     * between lists) of list items. Description copied from interface:<br>
     * Called when the drag operation has terminated with a drop on the operable part of the drop
     * site for the DropTarget registered with this listener.
     *
     * <p>This method is responsible for undertaking the transfer of the data associated with the
     * gesture. The DropTargetDropEvent provides a means to obtain a Transferable object that
     * represents the data object(s) to be transfered.
     *
     * <p>From this method, the DropTargetListener shall accept or reject the drop via the
     * acceptDrop(int dropAction) or rejectDrop() methods of the DropTargetDropEvent parameter.
     *
     * <p>Subsequent to acceptDrop(), but not before, DropTargetDropEvent's getTransferable() method
     * may be invoked, and data transfer may be performed via the returned Transferable's
     * getTransferData() method.
     *
     * <p>At the completion of a drop, an implementation of this method is required to signal the
     * success/failure of the drop by passing an appropriate boolean to the DropTargetDropEvent's
     * dropComplete(boolean success) method.
     *
     * <p>Note: The data transfer should be completed before the call to the DropTargetDropEvent's
     * dropComplete(boolean success) method. After that, a call to the getTransferData() method of
     * the Transferable returned by DropTargetDropEvent.getTransferable() is guaranteed to succeed
     * only if the data transfer is local; that is, only if DropTargetDropEvent.isLocalTransfer()
     * returns true. Otherwise, the behavior of the call is implementation-dependent.
