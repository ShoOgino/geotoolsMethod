    /**
     * Creates a vector grid of hexagonal elements. Hexagon size is expressed as
     * side length. To create hexagons of specified area you can use the static
     * {@linkplain Hexagons#areaToSideLength(double)} method to calculate the
     * equivalent side length.
     * <p>
     * The hexagons created by this method are orientated with a pair of edges
     * parallel to the top and bottom of the bounding envelope
     * ({@linkplain org.geotools.grid.hexagon.Hexagon.Orientation#FLAT}). The
     * bounding rectangle of each hexagon has width {@code sideLen * 2.0} and
     * height {@code sideLen * sqrt(3.0)}.
     * <p>
     * The grid's origin is the minimum X and Y point of the envelope.
     * <p>
     * The feature type of grid features has two properties:
     * <ul>
     * <li>element - type Polygon
     * <li>id - type Integer
     * </ul>
     *
     * @param bounds bounds of the grid
     *
     * @param sideLen the length
     *
     * @return the vector grid
     *
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException
     *         if bounds is null or empty; or
     *         if sideLen is {@code <=} 0
