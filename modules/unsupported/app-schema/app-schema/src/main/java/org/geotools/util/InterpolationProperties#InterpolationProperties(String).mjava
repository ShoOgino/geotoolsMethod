     * Load properties from a configuration file.
     * 
     * <p>
     * 
     * The name of the properties file is constructed by appending ".properties" to the identifier.
     * If there is a system property with the name of this property file, it is used as a file to
     * load, otherwise the property file is loaded from the root of the classpath.
     * 
     * <p>
     * 
     * For example, if the identifier is <tt>app-schema</tt>:
     * 
     * <ul>
     * 
     * <li>If the system property <tt>app-schema.properties</tt> is set, e.g.
     * <tt>-Dapp-schema.properties=/path/to/some/local.properties</tt>, the indicated file, in this
     * case <tt>/path/to/some/local.properties</tt>, is loaded.
     * 
     * <li>Otherwise, the classpath resource <tt>/app-schema.properties</tt> is loaded.
     * 
     * </ul>
     * 
     * Before the properties are returned, all system properties are copied; this means that system
     * properties override any properties in the configuration file.
     * 
     * @param identifier
     *            string used to construct property file name
