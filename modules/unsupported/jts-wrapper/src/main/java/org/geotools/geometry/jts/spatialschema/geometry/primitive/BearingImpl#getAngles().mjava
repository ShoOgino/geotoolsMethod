     * Returns the azimuth and (optionnaly) the altitude. In this variant of bearing usually used
     * for 2D coordinate systems, the first angle (azimuth) is measured from the first coordinate
     * axis (usually north) in a counterclockwise fashion parallel to the reference surface tangent
     * plane. If two angles are given, the second angle (altitude) usually represents the angle
     * above (for positive angles) or below (for negative angles) a local plane parallel to the
     * tangent plane of the reference surface.
     *
     * @return An array of length 0, 1 or 2 containing the azimuth and altitude angles. @UML
     *     operation angle
     * @revisit Should we split this method in {@code getAzimuth()} and {@code getAltitude()}
     *     methods instead? Should we provides a {@code getDimension()} method too?
