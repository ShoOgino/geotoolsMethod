     * minimum level of continuity. This level is referred to as "C<sup>0</sup>" in mathematical
     * texts. A value of 1 means that the functions are continuous and differentiable at the
     * appropriate end point: "C<sup>1</sup>" continuity. A value of "n" for any integer means
     * <var>n</var>-times differentiable: "C<sup>n</sup>" continuity.
