     * Perform the contouring on the input {@linkplain GridCoverage2D} and returns the results as a
     * feature collection. You can control which contours are generated either by providing a list
     * of values via the {@code levels} argument, or by specifying the interval between contour
     * values via the {@code interval} argument. In the interval case, the resulting contour values
     * will be integer multiples of the specified interval. If both {@code levels} and {@code
     * interval} are supplied the {@code interval} argument is ignored.
     *
     * @param data the input grid coverage
     * @param band the coverage band to process; defaults to 0 if {@code null}
     * @param levels the values for which contours should be generated
     * @param interval the interval between contour values (if {@code levels} is not provided)
     * @param simplify whether to simplify contour lines by removing co-linear vertices; default is
     *     to simplify
     * @param smooth whether to apply Bezier smooth to the contours; default is no smoothing
     * @param roi an optional polygonal {@code Geometry} to define the region of interest within
     *     which contours will be generated
     * @return the contours a feature collection where each feature contains a contour as a
     *     {@linkplain LineString} and the contour value as a {@code Double}
