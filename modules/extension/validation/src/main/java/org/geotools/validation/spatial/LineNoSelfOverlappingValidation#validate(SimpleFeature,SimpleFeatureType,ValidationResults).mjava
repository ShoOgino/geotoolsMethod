     * <p>It does this by breaking up the LineString into two point segments then intersects them
     * all. If a segment has both of its points on another segment, then they overlap. This is not
     * true in all cases and this method has to be rewritten. If a segment spans two segments, this
     * method will say that they do not overlap when clearly they do.
