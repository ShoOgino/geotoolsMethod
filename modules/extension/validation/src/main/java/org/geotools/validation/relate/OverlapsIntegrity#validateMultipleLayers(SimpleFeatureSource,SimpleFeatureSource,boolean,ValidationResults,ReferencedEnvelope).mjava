     * <b>validateMultipleLayers Purpose:</b> <br>
     *
     * <p>This validation tests for a geometry overlaps another geometry. Uses JTS'
     * Geometry.overlaps(Geometry) and Geometry.contains(Geometry)method. The DE-9IM intersection
     * matrix for overlaps is: T*T***T** (for two points or two surfaces) 1*T***T** (for two curves)
     * Contains DE-9IM intersection matrix is T*F**F***. <b>Description:</b><br>
     *
     * <p>The function filters the FeatureSources using the given bounding box. It creates iterators
     * over both filtered FeatureSources. It calls overlaps() and contains()using the geometries in
     * the SimpleFeatureSource layers. Tests the results of the method call against the given
     * expected results. Returns true if the returned results and the expected results are true,
     * false otherwise. Author: bowens<br>

     * @param featureSourceA - the SimpleFeatureSource to pull the original geometries from. This
     *     geometry is the one that is tested for overlaping with the other
     * @param featureSourceB - the SimpleFeatureSource to pull the other geometries from - these
     *     geometries will be those that may overlap the first geometry
     * @param expected - boolean value representing the user's expected outcome of the test
     * @param results - ValidationResults
     * @param bBox - Envelope - the bounding box within which to perform the overlaps() and
     *     contains()
     * @return boolean result of the test
     * @throws Exception - IOException if iterators improperly closed
