     * <b>validateMultipleLayers Purpose:</b> <br>
     *
     * <p>This validation tests for a geometry crosses another geometry. Uses JTS'
     * Geometry.crosses(Geometry) method. <b>Description:</b><br>
     *
     * <p>The function filters the FeatureSources using the given bounding box. It creates iterators
     * over both filtered FeatureSources. It calls intersects() using the geometries in the
     * SimpleFeatureSource layers. Tests the results of the method call against the given expected
     * results. Returns true if the returned results and the expected results are true, false
     * otherwise. Author: bowens<br>

     *
     * @param featureSourceA - the SimpleFeatureSource to pull the original geometries from. This
     *     geometry is the one that is tested for intersecting with the other
     * @param featureSourceB - the SimpleFeatureSource to pull the other geometries from - these
     *     geometries will be those that may intersect the first geometry
     * @param expected - boolean value representing the user's expected outcome of the test
     * @param results - ValidationResults
     * @param bBox - Envelope - the bounding box within which to perform the intersects()
     * @return boolean result of the test
     * @throws Exception - IOException if iterators improperly closed
