     * <b>validateSingleLayer Purpose:</b> <br>
     *
     * <p>This validation tests for a geometry containing part of itself. Uses JTS'
     * Geometry.contains(Geometry) method. DE-9IM intersection matrix is T*F**F***.
     * <b>Description:</b><br>
     *
     * <p>The function filters the SimpleFeatureSource using the given bounding box. It creates
     * iterators over the filtered FeatureSource. It calls contains() using the geometries in the
     * SimpleFeatureSource layer. Tests the results of the method call against the given expected
     * results. Returns true if the returned results and the expected results are true, false
     * otherwise. * Author: bowens<br>

     * @param featureSourceA - the SimpleFeatureSource to pull the original geometries from. This
     *     geometry is the one that is tested for containing the other
     * @param expected - boolean value representing the user's expected outcome of the test
     * @param results - ValidationResults
     * @param bBox - Envelope - the bounding box within which to perform the contains()
     * @return boolean result of the test
     * @throws Exception - IOException if iterators improperly closed
