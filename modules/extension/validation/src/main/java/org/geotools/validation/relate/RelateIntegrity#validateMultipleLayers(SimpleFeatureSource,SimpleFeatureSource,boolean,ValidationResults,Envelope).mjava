     * <b>validateMultipleLayers Purpose:</b> <br>
     *
     * <p>This validation tests for a geometry crosses another geometry. Uses JTS'
     * Geometry.crosses(Geometry) method. <b>Description:</b><br>
     *
     * <p>The function filters the FeatureSources using the given bounding box. It creates iterators
     * over both filtered FeatureSources. It calls relate() using the geometries in the
     * SimpleFeatureSource layers. Tests the results of the method call against the given expected
     * results. Returns true if the returned results and the expected results are true, false
     * otherwise.
     *
     * <p>The following is taken from JTS documentation for Geometry.relate(): "Returns true if the
     * elements in the DE-9IM intersection matrix for the two Geometrys match the elements in
     * intersectionPattern , which may be: 0 1 2 T ( = 0, 1 or 2) F ( = -1) * ( = -1, 0, 1 or 2) For
     * more information on the DE-9IM, see the OpenGIS Simple Features Specification." Author:
