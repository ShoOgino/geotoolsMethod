     * Returns a list of properties of the specified object.
     * <p>
     * The return list contains a set of {@link QName}, {@link Object} tuples,
     * each as a two element object array.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * This method should only be implemented in the case where the encoder
     * can not determine what the properties of the object are from the schema.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * An example would be an object which corresponds to an element in the
     * schema which has a the type <code>xs:anyType</code>. Since the content
     * of this type can be anything the schema has no way to determine what
     * the properties are. So in this case this method must specify the
     * properties manually as a set of name, object tuples.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * In the case of a multi-valued property, this method must return a tuple
     * for each instance of the property, and not a list, iterator, or array
     * containing all of the instances.
     * </p>
     * @param object the object being encoded.
     *
     * @return A list of the properties for the object.
     * @deprecated use {@link #getProperties(Object, XSDElementDeclaration)}.
