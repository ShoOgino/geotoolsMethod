    /**
     * From the Web Map Service Implementation Specification: "The required BBOX parameter allows a
     * Client to request a particular Bounding Box. The value of the BBOX parameter in a GetMap
     * request is a list of comma-separated numbers of the form "minx,miny,maxx,maxy". If the WMS
     * server has declared that a Layer is not subsettable, then the Client shall specify exactly
     * the declared Bounding Box values in the GetMap request and the Server may issue a Service
     * Exception otherwise."
     *
     * <p>NOTE: In WMS 1.3.0, the specification of "EPSG:4326" has the axis swapped, so a request
     * made in 1.1.1 using "minx,miny,maxx,maxy" would use "miny,minx,maxy,maxx" in 1.3.0. Only when
     * using EPSG:4326!
     *
     * <p>Currently it is up to the client to do this on there own. TODO Accept Envelopes and
     * doubles instead of Strings, and perform the 1.3.0 conversion automatically. Also note that
     * not all servers may implement this. Should provide an option to use 1.1.1 format even when
     * using 1.3.0.
     *
     * @param bbox A string representing a bounding box in the format "minx,miny,maxx,maxy"
