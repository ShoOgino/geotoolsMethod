    /**
     * From the Web Map Service Implementation Specification: "The required
     * BBOX parameter allows a Client to request a particular Bounding Box.
     * The value of the BBOX parameter in a GetMap request is a list of
     * comma-separated numbers of the form "minx,miny,maxx,maxy". If the WMS
     * server has declared that a Layer is not subsettable, then the Client
     * shall specify exactly the declared Bounding Box values in the GetMap
     * request and the Server may issue a Service Exception otherwise."
     *
     * NOTE: In WMS 1.3.0, the specification of "EPSG:4326" has the axis
     * swapped, so a request made in 1.1.1 using "minx,miny,maxx,maxy" would
     * use "miny,minx,maxy,maxx" in 1.3.0. Only when using EPSG:4326!
     * 
     * Currently it is up to the client to do this on there own.
     * TODO Accept Envelopes and doubles instead of Strings, and perform
     * the 1.3.0 conversion automatically. Also note that not all servers
     * may implement this. Should provide an option to use 1.1.1 format even
     * when using 1.3.0.
     *
     * @param bbox A string representing a bounding box in the format
     *        "minx,miny,maxx,maxy"
