     * Gets the id of a tile, which can be used for caching purposes.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The id is a file-friendly name (that is, should contains no special
     * characters such as ".", "/", etc. The id should be build from the code
     * (which also uniquely identifies a tile, but, in some service
     * implementation may contain file-unfriendly characters (e.g.
     * OpenStreetMap: 5/16/10.png).
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * When building an id, you should use the service name as a prefix (e.g.
     * for OpenStreetMap: "Mapnik", "CycleMap"; Bing Maps: "Road", "Hybrid";
     * etc) and suffix the id with a file-friendly string (e.g. OpenStreetMap:
     * "Mapnik_X_Y_Z").
